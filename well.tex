% A handy document for myself to see what verses are already written and
% which ones still need to be written.

% Creation
\wverse{1}{At the darkest depths of the WELL the waters ebb and rise.}
\wverse{2}{Yet in the motion of receding it gave chance for the water to birth its first children.}
\wverse{3}{These children shape the water of the WELL with thoughts of love and hatred.}
\wverse{4}{It is them, and their creations, that were, are, and will be; for their lives rest beneath the ebb and the flood.}

% Daemons
\wverse{18}{The waters of the WELL are opaque, shallow and a barrier not easily traversed.}
\wverse{19}{All beings rise above, few live between, and even fewer breathe beneath.}
\wverse{20}{Beware of the ones that sleep beneath the black waters.}
\wverse{21}{For they are beyond the horizons of time and space.}

% God and amongst Gods
\wverse{25}{You might be above the sea, the grass, the mountain, and even the bird; but the depths of the WELL are your firmament.}
\wverse{26}{For the water of the WELL nourished and cradled you, when there was nothing but darkness in its depths.}
