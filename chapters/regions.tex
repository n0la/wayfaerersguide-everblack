\section{Regions}
\label{sec:Regions}

Although civilisation can mostly be found in the large city kingdoms, it does
not mean that the more rural areas are filled with savages. Many big regions
share similar cultures or backgrounds, and it is not uncommon to find people
that have moved out of their city kingdoms into these areas. Either to start a
simpler live as farmers, or because a business opportunity or the love of
their life has drawn them there.  Likewise many people move from the country
side to the big cities in the hopes of finding better opportunities, such as
jobs and education there.

The following chapter of this book should introduce you to several regions of
Aror. Their culture, their believes, as well as their struggles and victories.
Tread carefully in these regions, as you might find friend and foe alike.
