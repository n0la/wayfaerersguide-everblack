\section{Skills}
\label{sec:Skills}

A few skills have new uses, and some additional rules apply to them in
\emph{Everblack}.

\subsection{Knowledge}
\label{sec:Knowledge}

The knowledge family of skills have two new entries: \emph{Knowledge (Old Ways)}
and \emph{Knowledge (Soul Magic)}.

\emph{Knowledge (Old Ways)} encompasses the knowledge about rituals, practices,
believes and customs of the religion of the \nameref{sec:Old Ways}. It mixes
knowledge about the religion itself, as well as parts of soul magic, which are
presented in that religion in the form of ancient rituals and incantations.

\emph{Knowledge (Soul Magic)} functions much like \emph{Knowledge (Arcana)}
except for spells, magic and creatures related to soul magic.

\subsection{Speak Language}
\label{sec:Speak Language}

The common languages of \emph{Everblack} are summarized in the following
\hyperref[tbl:Languages]{table}.

    Old Teranim     & People of the \nameref{sec:Dirgewood} and by followers of the \nameref{sec:Old Ways} & Old Teranim \\
    Orcish          & Orcs                        & Taavid \\

  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Forgery}
\label{sec:Forgery}

Anyone who can cast \emph{Arcane Mark}, can attempt to forge a
\hyperref[sec:Citizen Mark]{citizen mark} or a \hyperref[sec:Slave Mark]{slave
mark} using the \emph{Forgery} skill while casting the spell. This special
use of forgery and the spell stretches the casting time to ten minutes. The
character takes the \emph{Forgery} check as normal, taking a -10 penalty on
the check. The same procedure can also be used to forge \hyperref[sec:Nobility
Mark]{nobility marks} but the \emph{Forgery} check incurs an additional -10
penalty, for a total of a -20 penalty on the skill check.

\subsection{Open Lock}
\label{sec:Open Lock}

Anyone who can also use the skill \emph{Spellcraft} can attempt to remove
a \nameref{sec:Slave Band} from a slave by using the \emph{Open Lock} skill.
This attempt requires a basic arcane lab, arcane ingredients worth fifty
shards which are consumed in the process, and takes one our to perform.
The DC of the \emph{Open Lock} and \emph{Spellcraft} is the caster level
of the slave band plus 30.
