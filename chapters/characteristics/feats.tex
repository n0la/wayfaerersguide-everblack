\subsection{Background Feats}

Everblack introduces one new feat type: \emph{background feats}. Each character
may take one background feat at level 1, which does not count toward the total
amount of feats the character may take. These feats represent your character's
background, early history or perhaps an education that your character has
completed before becoming an adventurer. These feats should help you place your
character into the world, as well as giving him connections towards religions,
organisations and events within the world.

Only one of these feats may be taken at level 1, unless otherwise specified.
For example certain elves (due to their long childhoods), may take two
background feats. Some of these feats have repercussions in how the world
views your character, so read these feat entries carefully. If in doubt,
discuss these feats with your DM first.
