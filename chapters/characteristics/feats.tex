\subsection{General Feats}
\label{sec:General Feats}

\begin{35efeat}{Improved Weapon Finesse}
  \srditem{Description}{You can add your dexterity modifier instead of your
    strength modifier to damage for weapons that can be used with Weapon
    Finesse}
  \srditem{Requirements}{Weapon Finesse, Bab 6, Dexterity 17}
\end{35efeat}

\begin{35efeat}{Craft Implant}
  \srditem{Description}{You can craft small magical implants that can be
    inserted into a creature's body. These implants then grant special or
    extraordinary abilities, or even spell like abilities. Crafting an implant
    takes one day for each 1000 g the implant costs, and you must spend $
    \frac{1}{25} $ of the implants gold cost in XP, and use up raw materials
    half of this GP cost.

    You can also mend a broken implant, which costs half the gold, XP, time
    and materials of what it would cost to create the item anew from scratch.

    An implant is created for a special creature type in mind and will only
    work for said creature. But for half the cost in gold, XP, time and
    materials of what it would cost new, you can adapt an existing implant
    for another creature type.

    Some implants incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in
    their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the
    item's base price. You must pay such a cost to create an item or to mend a
    broken one.

  \srditem{Prerequisite}{Caster level 3rd}

    for any future class levels, as long as they give you soul power points.
  }
  \srditem{Requirements}{Soul Awakening, 13+ Charisma}
\end{35efeat}
