\chapter{Aror}
\label{sec:Aror}

The world of Everblack is situated on a small planet that is called Aror. Aror
rotates around a binary star system we call Carinae. Both suns can be seen on
the sky, with one being slightly smaller than the other.

The planet also has two moons, one of which is named Lilest and the other
Storst, in honour of the two magi that first identified most of the celestial
bodies in our solar sytem. They have many different names in different
cultures and languages, but the names Lilest and Storst are always understood
to refer to the two moons in the night sky.

Aror takes roughly twenty-four (24) hours to rotate around its own axis, while
Lilest goes around the planet in thirty-two (32) days, the bigger moon Storst
takes forty-eight (48) days to make one trip around Aror. Aror itself takes
385 days to travel around the binary star constellation.

Aror is not alone in the system. It is in fact the third planet from the
suns. The first, we call Forun, and is a molten rock of magma, insane
temperatures and poisonous gases. Parin is seated between Forun and Aror, and
can be seen with the naked eye on a clear night sky as a blue shimmering
light. Then follow Ivir and Novar which are believed to be huge planets made
of various gases. Far beyond the reaches of Novar is Piad a smaller, rocky
planet on the edge of our binary star system.
