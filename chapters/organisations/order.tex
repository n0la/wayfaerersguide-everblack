\section{Four Holy Orders}
\label{sec:Four Holy Orders}

The holy orders are now four closely connected churches that all follow a
common religious dogma that worships the \nameref{sec:Order}.

The church was once composed of five holy orders, of which one has split off
into independence in \emph{MI:890}. The \emph{Fourth Order} is now known
as the \nameref{sec:Holy Order of Aleaste}.

The banner of the five holy orders is a simple but petite dagger pointing
towards the ground, forming a cross. All anointed members receive a
\hyperref[sec:Dagger of the Order]{ceremonial dagger}, as well as a holy
symbol of the order. These items are used in ceremonies, for identification,
as well as holy focuses and symbols for divine spell casting.

The Five Holy Orders are staunch believers in a basic set of tenements, laws
and guidelines and will fight for these, even if local laws would allow their
practise. They are a fierce opponents of slavery, indentured servitude, as
well as defilement of the dead through necromancy, or the corruption and
manipulation of souls. They are not against sentient undead as such, but will
seek and destroy any corrupted and evil undead.

\subsection{First Order}
\label{sec:First Order}

The first, and main order of the church, is responsible for keeping, maintaining
and teaching the main dogma of justice, law, and fighting of corruption in all
its prevailing forms. It trains both clerics and priests, as well as judges and
negotiators that offer their services to anyone who seeks their aid.

The Holy Orders believe that above all creatures and humanoid resides a bigger
structure of law and order. This order reigns absolute, and anyone who attempts
to place himself above it are doomed to fail or be corrupted into evil. It
further stipulates that this order is intrinsic to \emph{all} sentient
creatures, and that the five holy orders only help that true hierarchy of order
and law come forth within modern societies.

The first order is mainly known for providing experienced, well trained judges
and jurors to settle disputes, as well as offering their churches and
universities as neutral ground to settle disputes or to host diplomatic
meetings.

Those that join the First Order are granted training as clerics, priests,
judges, lawyers, diplomats as well as scholars on legal issues and
philosophy. And even though their word and judgement is held in high esteem by
many people, they are often in direct conflict with local laws and customs.

\begin{35e}{First Order}
  All in all the first order is seen as \emph{lawful good}, and its members
  are made up of clerics, bards (working as lawful diplomats), rogues (as
  investigators and diplomats) as well as monks. Their favoured weapon is the
  warhammer, and their domains are law, good, protection and healing.
\end{35e}

\subsection{Second Order}
\label{sec:Second Order}

The Second Order is responsible for keeping and maintaining the vast knowledge
of the five orders have amassed over the centuries. They write and collect all
knowledge, dogma as well as the laws and rulings of the other orders, offering
them for all to read, learn and study. They are scholars, librarians,
explorers, archaeologists as well as practitioners of the arcane arts.

People that join the second order are often trained to be seekers of
knowledge, such as wandering priests, arcane scholars as well as those that
venture forth into ruins and foreign lands to seek new knowledge to add the
vast libraries the order maintains.

The libraries of the second order are open to anyone, and think that knowledge
will help anyone who is willing to help themselves. They are often in bitter
conflict with the \nameref{sec:Well of Truth}, and \nameref{sec:Aria}
followers in general, who seek to hide and hoard knowledge instead of
providing it to those that seek it.

\begin{35e}{Second Order}
  The Second Order is considered \emph{neutral}, and its members are often
  clerics, wizards, scholars, researchers, scientists and any that seek to
  collect and preserve knowledge. Their favoured weapon is the light pick,
  and their domains are knowledge, law, magic, and travel.
\end{35e}

\subsection{Third Order}
\label{sec:Third Order}

The Third Order is an order of knights, inquisitors and honourable warriors
that acts as the executive branch of the five orders. They are sent to arrest,
imprison or even execute criminals, as well as defend the innocent, pilgrims
and priests, judges and scholars of the other orders.

As knighthood they only accept members of nobility as knights, but offer
inquisitor positions to anyone who succeeds a cruelling three year tutelage
under an already established inquisitor or knight. Those that join the third
order are trained to be jurors, investigators as well as fighters, warriors and
crusaders against injustice and corruption.

Knights and inquisitors of the third order are also often sent to deal with
supernatural threats or destroy evil creatures, such as corrupted undead,
werewolves, daemons, devils, fey or evil spell casters. Even though this is
not the main purpose of the Third Order, they are notoriously efficient in
eliminating those threats in combination with priests and holy men of the
First Order.

Highly unpopular within most city kingdoms, the inquisitors of the Third Order
enact their justice without the aid of the local law enforcement agency, and
often punish people whose actions are morally wrong, but still legal by local
law. Although the inquisition is known to side with those that are treated
unfairly, their popularity and support among the general population is
limited. Many see it as a bad omen or a sign of trouble when the Inquisition
appears to render justice.

\begin{35e}{Third Order}
  Even though the Third Order is considered \emph{lawful neutral}, there are
  some \emph{lawful evil} elements and members present within the order. The
  Order's members are mostly clerics, paladins (of all lawful alignments),
  knights, fighters, duskblades and eldritch knights as well as rogues that
  act as investigators. Their domains are war, strength, protection and law.
\end{35e}

\subsection{Fifth Order}
\label{sec:Fifth Order}

The fifth order is a monastic church, that believes that law and order can only
be brought forth by inner piece and calm. They often live secluded lives in
monasteries and temples, renounce any wordly pursuits and instead focus on
spiritual and fundamental issues through philosophy. Even though they train
their bodies physically in martial arts to achieve greater discipline, they
believe that violence is only justified if all other pursuits have failed.

Those that join the Fifth Order train religiously both in martial arts, as well
as philosophy, natural sciences and religious dogma and believes. They are often
monks, diplomats, philosophers and scholars, and widely respected as such all
over Aror.

\begin{35e}{Fifth Order}
  The Fifth Order is considered \emph{lawful good}, and its favoured weapon is
  the unarmed strike. It's members are mostly monks and clerics, but they will
  accept anyone who seeks redemption and spiritual enlightenment through a
  monastic way of life. Their domains are law, good, knowledge and strength.
\end{35e}
