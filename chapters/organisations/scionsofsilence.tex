\section{Scions of Silence}
\label{sec:Scions of Silence}

The Scions of Silence are a warrior order that still following the teachings
of the \nameref{sec:Silent Queen}. Their height of power was during the
\nameref{sec:Holy Crusade}, after which they waned in power and influence
with their goddess' demise. Still, small orders of the scions persist to
this day.

Their members must make a vow of silence, and many dedicated scions this to an
extreme and either cut out their tongues or sew their mouth shut to prevent
them from talking. They swear to obedience to the scion order itself, and
pledge before their now dead queen to protect the followers of the queen
against all and any threats. Since the followers of the queen have dwindled in
numbers, the scions have shifted their focus on destroying enemies of the
queen to take revenge on her death and betrayal.

Most Scions are now nothing but inquisitors that seek out and destroy any and
all followers of \nameref{sec:Aria}. Worshippers of Aria that are caught by
the scions are executed by fire, and their businesses and property are
destroyed. Since Aria worship is widespread in most city kingdoms and nations,
that often brings them in direct conflict with local authorities, and other
holy orders that seek to establish the rule of law.

During the era of the Silent Queen the Scions of Silence were once a respected
holy knight order, but have since fallen from grace and public knowledge. Then
they sought and harboured dangerous secrets, keeping them from being misused
or falling into the wrong hands. Their noble goals and reputation for being
incorruptible, steadfast and noble have since vanished. Now they are nothing
more than a violent cult that destroys and murders followers of Aria wherever
they can find them. The Scions recruit new young members through violence,
indoctrination and bind them to the order through fear, violence and
threats. Most members can no longer live in nations, baronies or city kingdoms
as their actions within the scions have made them wanted fugitives.

\begin{35e}{Scions of Silence}
  Few scions of silence still follow the old tenants and traditions of the order
  that would make them \emph{lawful neutral} as whole.

  Most follow the new teachings of betrayal and hatred toward followers of Aria,
  and are thus as a whole \emph{neutral evil}.
