\section{Two Courts}
\label{sec:Two Courts}

Aror has two organisations, two courts to be exact, whose sole purpose is to
deal with planetary wide threats and events. These two organisations are the
\emph{Court of the Moons} (often shortened to the ``moon court'') and the
\emph{Court of the Suns} (often shortened to the ``sun court'').

The Court of the Moons includes every major political figure of Aror, such
as kings, queens, powerful barons, representatives from various powerful
organisations such as the Ror-Aram Trading Guild, Velvet Hand, and House Ranian.
The court meets frequently, often several times a year, in different city
kingdoms. Its main purpose is to coordinate the larger kingdoms and
organisations in times of crisis, but also to settle disputes and diplomatic
altercations. Wars between nations are brought before the court, and the
peace treaties that followed were also negotiated within the court. Large
treaties and accords, such as the \nameref{sec:Vonir Accord} were also
negotiated within the Court of the Moons, and is thus instrumental to keep
and maintain global peace.

The Court of the Suns, is the second court held on Aror, often in different
city kingdoms albeit less frequently compared to the Court of the Moons. Any
member of the Court of the Moons are also automatically members of the Court
of the Suns. Furthermore the court also includes particularly powerful
individuals, such as powerful wizards, priests, soul witches, leaders of the
various knight orders, powerful psykers, but also criminal elements that could
potentially aid with a global crisis, such as pirates, smugglers and various
thief and assassin guilds. The main purpose of the Court of the Suns is to
detect and repel planet wide threats such as devil invasions, plagues,
incursions of the scourge, awakenings of ancient evils, nefarious gods or even
the plots of other evil powerful individuals that seek to bring harm to the
world. Being appointed to the Court is an honour to most, and also comes with
certain benefits. Any member travelling to, or on the behest of the court is
granted immunity and often special diplomatic powers.
