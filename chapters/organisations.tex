\section{Organisations}
\label{sec:Organisations}

Aror is home to several large factions, churches, organisations, guilds and
corporations that offer a variety of economical services. Many of these guilds
rival the city kingdoms in power and influence, while others are an integral
part of these kingdoms are allow them project their force and power both
inside and outside their lands.

These organisations often vie for each other's power, wealth and often have
to content with secret plots, espionage and sabotage as well as open war
and conflict. Most are patrons to adventurers, but beware, today they might
be your allies, tomorrow they may very well be your competitors or even
opponents.
