\chapter{Magic Items}
\label{sec:Magic Items}

Magic is flows through the world of Aror. Magical devices and items
are made possible by ingenious engineers and wizards that embed
\nameref{sec:Everblack} into every day items to allow them to harness
the power of magic. Magical items, trinkets and devices are sold and
purchased by the wealthy, and are a major source of economical income
for many large nations and city kingdoms.

These devices would not be possible without everblack, and all native
magical devices and items made on Aror contain at least trace amounts
of the black crystal. It depends of course on the item in question how
much everblack is required to create or power a magical artefact, but
the black crystal is always required in the creation process.

\begin{35e}{Everblack in Magical Items}
  Everblack is needed in the creation of all magical items and artefacts.
  Take the cost in gold required during the item's creation and convert
  it into platinum. Then divide that number by two and you know how much
  \hyperref[sec:Shard]{shards} worth of everblack crystals are required to
  create the item. The other half are material costs as normal, and may be
  paid with gold.
