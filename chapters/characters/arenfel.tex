\subsection{Aren Fel}
\label{sec:Aren Fel}

Aren Fel of \nameref{sec:Nicte}, also known as the ``Undying Witch'' (born
sometime around GT:24) is a \hyperref[sec:Deepkin]{Deepkin}
\hyperref[sec:Soul Magic]{soul witch}, priestess of the \nameref{sec:Silent
  Queen}, thief, diplomat, author, historian and arcane scholar.

Her family tree, blood line, birth and association with House Nicte have been
thoroughly documented in her birthplace, which now lies within the kingdom of
\nameref{sec:Stenheim}. And even though she possess new female deepkin bodies
to stay alive over the aeons, her continued longevity as been independently
confirmed by several other long-lived species, including vampires, dragons and
even giants, who were able to recognise her unique soul across the centuries.
This is also why her appearance is not described, as it would be a fruitless
labour.

Initially born into the Nicte family clan, she was trained preliminary as a
diplomat, thief, spy and trader. As the battles of the aeon of strife came
closer to her family, she was also hastily trained in combat, and joined the
fighting as an archer and scout. It was during those skirmishes that her
\hyperref[sec:Soul Awakening]{soul broke} setting Aren on the path of becoming
one of the most powerful soul witches ever to walk on Aror. With her new found
powers, she realised she could potentially live forever by moving her soul
from one body to the next, often killing the soul in the target body in the
process.

During her unnaturally long life-span she has mostly used her extensive
training from her Deepkin clan to forge alliances, gather artefacts and
manoeuvre smaller baronies together, to act against common threats, especially
during the early centuries of the aeon of strife. Aren was thus instrumental in
the early history of the north-western part of \nameref{sec:Goltir}, by making
sure the core humanoid settlements remained allied with each other. Aren was
instrumental in paving the way for both Stenheim and \nameref{sec:Forsby} to
rise to be global powers.

Recorded history has it that she was instrumentally involved in lessening the
extend and cruelty of the \nameref{sec:Holy Crusade} by actively opposing
the persecution of low-ranking followers of Griannar, including the general
congregation and low-ranking acolytes. Aren thus directly stood against her own
high-priestess \nameref{sec:Aria}, causing a schism within the church of the
\nameref{sec:Silent Queen}. Between the warring faction following Aria on one
side, and a pacifist congregation that followed Aren on the other. Aren
further aided \nameref{sec:Hraglund} during the plague, and assisted the
kingdom in finding a cure by securing the help of important arcane
institutions including the \nameref{sec:Hall of Knowledge} and
\nameref{sec:Magistrata Arcanum}. The last recorded appearance of Aren was
during the siege of Forsby, where she smuggled \nameref{sec:Everblack Golem}
made by Stenheim into the city to help with the defence against the devils.

Although her achievements are well recorded, so are the means by which she
attained them. Aren is notorious for Machiavellian scheming, in which she places
a quick and satisfactory end of the crisis at hand above anything, even the
well being of the people she is supposed to protect. Her general philosophy
that allows any means, as long as the goal at hand is met, has lead to her to
commit blackmail, theft, slavery and murder. Her blatant disregard for the lives
of others - for example by killing the souls of future hosts, to extend her
own lifespan - made her an enemy of many greater organisations, including the
church of \nameref{sec:Lor}, \nameref{sec:Order}, and she is a persona non
grata in many city kingdoms, including Forsby, Fes al-Bashir, and Tredeg√•r.

\label{sec:Witch Hunt}
The power she wields, both literally as a powerful soul witch, and
figuratively through her web of alliances, caused a lot of animosity and open
hostility from other powerful organisations. In MI:20, after the Holy Crusade,
the \nameref{sec:Knight Order of Tavos} attempted to catch, trial and execute
Aren. A literal witch hunt began, that lasted from MI:20 to MI:28 that caused
many innocent Deepkin women harm, caused them to lose their freedom and even
their lives in an attempt to bring Aren to justice. This is period of time is
now known as the ``Witch Hunt'', and is considered the sole fault of the Knight
Order of Tavos.

Nevertheless her knowledge of the world, its inhabitants, the creatures and
threats of the planes, arcane, and soul magic is extensive, as is her web
work of power, alliances, and ability to influence even the most powerful
organisations is very often welcomed again at a time of crisis.

\begin{note}
  Aren can serve many purposes in your campaign: she can be the secondary
  villain, prime villain, or simply be an aid to the party, preparing them
  to face the actual villain. She will \emph{never} work towards the doom of
  Aror, or its citizens on purpose, but will use \emph{whatever means
    necessary} to achieve goals. Even though these goals may overlap with
  that of a good PC party (i.e. saving the world), her methodology and
  philosophy make her an evil character in terms of D\&D alignment.
