\section{Grand Magi Triumvirate}
\label{sec:Triumvirate}

The \emph{Grand Magi Triumvirate} (or simply the Triumvirate) is the informal
name given to three snow-elven sisters (triplets), called Euryale, Stheno and
Medusa, that were powerful grand magi wizards of the \nameref{sec:Magistrata
  Arcanum}.

The sisters were born in GT:713 on the western shore of Arania, as citizens of
the rising kingdom of Esmayar. After learning what arcane knowledge they could
in the recently founded kingdom, they moved to Fes al-Bashir and applied to the
\nameref{sec:Hall of Knowledge}. Although they were accepted as students, after
several failures to adapt to the strict and traditional culture of the city and
the university, the sisters were expelled. They travelled north, settled in
Forsby and joined the Magistrata Arcanum. After finishing their studies in the
Arcanum, they joined the staff as tutors, professors and teachers, culminating
in their ascension to high magus and leader of the Arcanum in GT:750. They
ruled the Magistrata Arcanum together, thus earning them the name and title of
``triumvirate''. In GT:752 they completed all tasks required to become Grand
Magi, and were awarded that honorific by the Hall of Knowledge.

In GT:755, during the \nameref{sec:First Devil Invasion} the three sisters
were believed to be dead, when the devils detonated a magical artefact causing
the hall of the Magistrata to collapse. In truth the devils had used the
explosion as a ploy, and had instead abducted the three sisters on the orders
of \nameref{sec:Forneus}.

During their time in the layers, Forneus forced them to research the
``Marilith'', mightiest creature of battle the \nameref{sec:Scourge} had
produced. After the sisters had found the creatures weaknesses, capabilities
and origins, Forneus forced them to continue their research into either
freeing Mariliths from their psionic enslavement, or by producing new
Mariliths loyal to the devils. The work was slow, but Forneus kept the sisters
alive for centuries so that they may be able to complete their work. The
sisters almost finished their work, but they ultimately refused to cooperate
when the devil lord wanted to test their work on captured humanoids, aurelis
and tieflings. Enraged by their refusal to cooperate, Forneus used the
conversion serum on the sisters, turning them into hideous half-human,
half-snake like creatures. Their lower torsos were turned into that of a
snake, while their upper bodies remained human, their skin grew patches of
scales, and their eyes turned completely red.

Forneus was impressed by the partial transformation, and ordered his minions to
replicate the serum, and begin converting as many of his slaves as possible.
Although he attempted to force the sisters to perfect their formula, they
instead began to research a cure. Not only for themselves, but also for those
who'd now also be forced through this horrible transformation.

In \emph{GT:1082}, almost 330 years after being abducted, the forces of the
second crusade attempted to free the sisters. At the eve of their rescue the
sisters told Forneus that they had created a serum, and distributed it to his
victims, allowing them to turn back to their original form. Forneus, in
vengeful retaliation, cursed the sisters by turning their hair into snakes,
and turning anyone their eyes would meet into stone, and told them that the
crusaders will not find the humanoids they were searching for, only monsters.

After the crusaders returned them from the layers of hell, the sisters split
up and hid themselves away in the remote places of Aror. Euryale went into the
Goban jungle, Stheno in the jungles of Yua'cata and Medusa hid in the Savage
Lands. Even though the lived in exile, they earned themselves followers who
attempted to aid them in finding a cure. But without the life extending magic
of Forneus they health declined faster than their progress towards a cure. On
the behest of their followers, and \hyperref[sec:Medusa]{children}, they
entered a deep sleep, a magical stasis, until a cure could be found.
