\subsection{Irene de'Var}
\label{sec:Irene deVar}

Irene de'Var, Countess of Saremen, is the current ruler of \nameref{sec:House
  deVar} of Saremen in \nameref{sec:Helmarnock}, and thus one of the five
rulers that make up the council of the city kingdom.

Irene is about two metres tall, and has short white dyed hair, deep and dark
red eyes, and blue finger nails that show her usage of \nameref{sec:Ramesk}.
Her origin as a \hyperref[sec:Snow Elves]{snow elf} has granted her with
natural grace and beauty, which she complements with elaborate and intricate
silken garments, expensive and impressive jewellery (both magic and mundane)
as well as graceful posture and mannerism.

The countess is seen as a cunning politician, and a passionate and genius
orator capable of inspiring and moving their subjects through speeches, and
using her commanding presence and eloquence to resolve conflicts through
negotiations. To her people she shows her warmer, more compassionate side,
often meeting her own subjects on festivities or other special occasions.

Originally a snow elf diplomat of Helmarnock stationed in \nameref{sec:Forsby},
she was turned into a vampire in MI:1081 by the Count Nareil of House de'Var,
to serve as an heir in his lineage of nobility. His nobility has roots back to
the time of the great betrayal by \nameref{sec:Morana} during the aeon of
strife, and was instrumental in establishing and defending the city on the
island of Saremen amidst the constant wars and battles fought against the
beast races.

Irene has ruled House de'Var since MI:1121 after the death of Nareil who
restructured and reformed the House, leading them to become the most dominant
noble family on the island. Irene largely follows Nareil's traditions and
teaching, and stays true to Nareil's style of leadership of benevolence and
diplomacy: Irene outlawed slavery on Saremen in MI:1122 freeing all who were
previously enslaved to a citizen of Saremen, and pushed the council to allow
\nameref{sec:Umgeher} and \nameref{sec:Gorgons} back into the kingdom. The ban
on slavery was partially effective, since the city kingdom has signed the
\nameref{sec:Vonir Accord} before her push toward slave liberation. Even
though no new slaves may be taken within Saremen, and all slaves of Saremen
citizens have been freed, slavers of other nations, including the other
islands of Helmarnock are still allowed to follow that practice on Saremen.
She initiated a council vote on slavery, but was defeated two to three.

Generally Irene de'Var attempts to drive the society of Saremen towards
individualism, liberty and freedom, lifting many restrictions both in the
social sphere - such as lifting marriage restrictions between mortals and
vampires, ending slavery or allowing Gorgons to become citizens - as well as
in the economical sphere by lowering taxes and making it easier for companies
to do business. Her political leanings and open policies, together with her
well-received, compassionate speeches towards her subjects, have made her a
well beloved and respected countess among the citizens of Saremen. Although
she is a brilliant politician and orator, she keeps a cadre of highly skilled
advisers as a ``council of ministers'' that oversee other aspects of the
island, such as defence, finances, civil engineering or oversee the Academy of
Arcane Arts.
