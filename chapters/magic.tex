\chapter{Magic in Everblack}
\label{sec:Magic}

Magic is ever present in the world of Everblack. It is used by scholars and
wizards, to improve the lives of everyone, or by dark and ruthless mages to
bring harm and war upon the world. This chapter discusses the foundations of
magic within the world of Everblack, and brings new rules for magical effects
such as \emph{rituals} and \emph{soul magic}.

\section{Three Sources of Magic}

There are three main sources of magic in the world of Everblack. Both divine
and arcane magic, is an ever present form of power that seeps from the planes
of the \hyperref[sec:Lesser Deities]{lesser} and \hyperref[sec:True
  Deities]{true deities} into the material plane. The distinction is that
divine magic is granted already prepared in the form of spells to divine
casters, while arcane researchers and scholars build their own spells out of
the raw magical energy.

The second power are psionical powers, which manifest in the powerful minds of
psionic creatures such as \nameref{sec:Ilians}. They do not draw their power
from the same pool as divine or arcane power, and come directly from the mind
of the powerful being that casts that spell.

The third magical source of power is the soul of living beings, which allows
one to cast \emph{soul magic}. This power is either drawn from one's own soul,
or from souls of those around them. Much like psionic power, it stems directly
from the trained or inherent power of the individual, and does not rely on
external sources, such as a raw energy web that seeps in from other planes.
While arcane or divine necromancy is the art of manipulating and corrupting
souls, soul magic is the art and craft of using a souls inherent power to
shape and fuel spells.

\section{Rituals}
\label{sec:Rituals}

Rituals, or incantations, are powerful \emph{soul magic} or \emph{divine}
rituals can be cast by anyone, even those that are not arcane or divine
casters. These rituals often require specific words to be chanted, ritual
places specifically crafted and arranged for the incantation, often take
several hours of preparation and then to perform, and often require more than
person to be successfully performed.

The most prominent source of rituals are the lore and history of the
\nameref{sec:Old Ways}, as well as the lore of druidic circles. While the old
ways use rituals to heal, the druids use them for nefarious purposes, such as
cursing enemies with \hyperref[sec:True Lycanthropes]{true lycanthropy}.
