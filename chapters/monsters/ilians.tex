\subsection{Arnak}
\label{sec:monster:Arnak}

Arnaks were once the worker class of the \nameref{sec:Ilians}. They rely on
their brute bodily strength, and their sharp teeth to fight enemies. Arnaks
that are still part of an Ilian society are remotely controlled through
psionic machinery, and will carry out their tasks ignoring others unless they
are a distraction or danger to themselves. Lone Arnaks that have been
separated from their societies will return to an aggressive, savage behaviour;
attacking and eating anything humanoid they can find.

  }
  \srditem{Hibernation (Ex)}{Arnak loses Blindsense and Scent except when
    within 5 ft. when in hibernation beneath a stalactite. An Arnak in
    hibernation gains \emph{regeneration 3}.
  }
  \srditem{Arnak Spawn (Ex)}{If an arnak has a humanoid creature in a grapple
    or pin it can attempt to inject an \emph{Arnak Spawn} into the creature as
    a free action. A reflex slave DC 17 allows a grappled humanoid creature to
    shake off the spawn. If the victim is pinned or otherwise at the mercy of
    the Arnak no saving throw is allowed. An arnak spawn will drain its host
    for 1 point of constitution per day until 4d4 days have passed or the host
    dies prematurely of constitution drain. If the victim dies prematurely, so
    will the spawn. Once the spawn has matured, it will burst from the victims
    chest dealing 4d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC:16 half). Victims with an
    arnak spawn in their body are considered \emph{diseased}.
  }

\subsection{Elnak}
\label{sec:monster:Elnak}

Elnak are the crafting and tinkerer caste of the Ilians, and try to avoid open
conflict. If they are forced to fight, they prefer to rely on their limited
psionic powers, and will fall back to wielding blades once their psionic
powers have been spent.
