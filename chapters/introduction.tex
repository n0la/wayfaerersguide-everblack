\chapter{Everblack Campaign Setting}

The \emph{Everblack} campaign setting is a D\&D setting for 3.5e.  It is
written from the view of the two most prominent NPCs of the world:
\emph{Graham Balance} an influential archmagi and bard, and \emph{Aren Fel},
also known as the \emph{Undying Witch}, a chronicler and priestess of the
\emph{Silent Queen}. But more about them later on.

It is in fact a labour of love of one person, with input from many different
people and players. It was started in 2015 and continuously enhanced and
refined over the course of many years.

\section{Tone of Everblack}

One of the main defining features of \emph{Everblack} is the tone and attitude
of the campaign setting. It combines traditional fantasy settings with the love
for horror and a more EU centric lore. It also aims to introduce grit, moral
ambiguity, shades of moral gray and an everlasting fear of
death. Although \emph{Dark Sun} already does many of these aspects extra
ordinarily well already, \emph{Everblack} does not rely on a
post-apocalyptic surrounding. It's just that in \emph{Everblack} everything
tries to eat, kill or enslave you while you can also sniff pretty flowers on
the side of the road. However this does not mean that good does not exist in
this world. Like spices in cooking, you can overdo gritty and dark concepts in
a work of fiction.

The world of \emph{Everblack} is old, and rich in history. Filled with old
legends, gods long dead, and civilisations that have long fallen. Those that
venture outside the save walls of the major city kingdoms, will find strange
creatures, obscure cults, death and peril, but also adventures, powerful
artefacts and great riches.

Magic is a major part of the setting, and is augmented by a new, and fourth
form of magic: \emph{soul magic}. While in \emph{Everblack} both arcane and
divine magic come from the gods, \emph{soul magic} is inherent to every living
being, much like psionic powers. However \emph{soul magic} is often
misunderstood, shunned and even forbidden by the followers of the lesser gods.

But still the world of \emph{Everblack} is a place where adventurers set forth
to slay the beast and bring back the gold. A world full of magic, ancient
artifacts, but also of eldritch horrors, great strife and despair.

\section{Seven things to you should know}

\begin{enumerate}
 \litem{Not everything within D\&D fits} Many creatures, concepts, classes and
 races that are part of the basic D\&D do not fit into \emph{Everblack}. Some
 monsters may be extinct, classes might be rarer in \emph{Everblack} than
 elsewhere, and some concepts do not directly fit within the world
 itself. While this might bar you from certain concepts and mechanics, this
 was done deliberately to enhance the tone and attitude of the campaign
 setting.

 \litem{Overall tone} \emph{Everblack} attempts to blend horror and evil with
 D\&D. It aims to convey a world where ancient malevolent beings rule from the
 shadows. Where horrible and sadistic creatures just lurk in the dark forest
 beyond your village waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. Where the
 world itself is dark, horrible, cruel, unfair, dirty and filthy. A world were
 slavery is as much accepted, as an evil Inquisition that enacts vigilante
 justice across the face of the world. Where evil witches are meticulously
 persecuted and burnt at stake, and entire city kingdoms move forth with a
 continent wide genocide of what they deem \emph{lesser} races.
 \emph{Everblack} is not a nice neighbourhood.

 \litem{Soul Magic} The setting introduces a new, fourth kind of magic to the
 world: \emph{soul magic}. It postulates that every living being has a soul,
 from which the being can draw power from. This power might enhance martial
 abilities or may be directly shaped into magic spells. Arcane and divine
 magic comes directly from the realm of the gods, and they have used both as a
 tool to manipulate the mortal races for aeons. Often
 \hyperref[sec:Religion]{lesser deities} see soul magic as an aberration, and
 thus manipulate their followers into seeking out and destroying soul magic
 everywhere they can find it. To those untrained in the arts of the soul, a
 person with an affliction in the soul might just be another undead creature,
 fuelling misconceptions and ignorance among the general populace.

 \litem{Aror is a global place} The planet of Everblack, known as Aror, has a
 few very important and big city kingdoms which are connected with each other
 with an arcane teleporter network. Although the cities charge money for the
 usage of these teleporters it has made the world smaller. Commoners, traders
 and adventurers use them regularly to visit other city kingdoms, to travel,
 do trade and exchange cultures. These teleporters are limited to large cities
 as the network requires constant care of magi and wizards to be kept
 operational.

 \litem{Everblack} The setting is named after the \nameref{sec:Everblack}
 crystal. Pitch black crystals that can store any magical energy. They are
 often used to aid casters, fuel arcane machinery. \emph{Everblack} is
 extremely rare, so much so that shards of it have replaced platin as the
 major currency for large purchases. The crystals are used in \emph{soul
 magic} research, but also in arcane experiments and arcane machinery. It his
 highly sought after all across the world, and entire societies depend on it
 for mining, trade and arcane constructions.

 \litem{New Races} In addition to the common player races, \emph{Everblack}
 introduces three new races: the \nameref{sec:Deepkin}, \nameref{sec:Diarim}
 as well as the \nameref{sec:Umgeher}. Deepkin are the cavern dwelling cousins
 of the human races, with dark vision, bright white skin and flowing red
 hair. While Umgeher are a half undead species of humans that were created by
 powerful vampires a long time ago as servants. Diarim are a slave race which
 were bred by the giants for battle against their mortal enemies the dragons.

 \litem{Death means Death} Unlike many other settings death is often final
 within the world of Everblack. Only the gods themselves can raise people from
 the dead by first transporting their souls to their realm. If a god lifts you
 to their realm, and then releases you again is within their own power to
 decide. Although the divine magic for raising dead is available, it fails more
 often than it succeeds. The gods rarely release their new possessions, soul
 included. But this fear of death holds true for everyone. An outsider is not
 sent back to his or her home plane on death, but dies. Permanently. Fey are
 not mysteriously birthed again in the world should they die or be slain, no,
 they die forever just like the rest of the mortal souls on the world.

\section{Foreword by Graham Balance}

The following book should serve you well as an introduction to the
place you might only know as the place \emph{where everblack comes
  from}. I, Archmagi Graham Balance, would like you welcome you to
our corner of the multiverse: ``Aror''.

This book will serve you as a guide to Aror's many places, cultures,
customs, people and creatures. I am fortunate to have counted this
place as my home for many years, and it holds a special place in my
heart. Great was the dismay when I had to discover on my frequent
travels and journyes to other planes, that our tiny little speck of
the multiverse was not very well know, or perhaps only known as the
``place where Everblack crystals come from''. While true, it saddens
me deeply to see our fine planet, and its people, reduced to the mere
fact that we export black crystals charged with arcane energy. That
experience was the sole motivator on why I am wrote this book: To bring
our way of life to you, dear reader.

I have interviewed many that did come to Aror, and most of them only
remembered the bad things that had happened to them in their short
visit: unfriendly locals speaking weird tongues, stale ale, and the
occasional blind subterranean humanoid that tried to eat them. While
many of these aspects are true, they are warped exaggerations of the
truth. My sincere hopes are that, after reading through this book, you
have arrived at the conclusion that Aror is a place worth visiting,
that our ale is as good as any - if not better - and that the
cannibalistic blind humanoid creatures of the deep are too far and few
between to be a real threat.

You will have heard our most treasured places, such as the holy lake of
\emph{Mu'ut} in the south; the lone yet towering \emph{Goban} mountain in the
east; the endless treasures, archipelagos and beaches that the \emph{Silver
  Isles} have to offer; or the vast mountains, lush forests, and friendly
locals of \emph{Eilean Mor}. If that does not impress you, I am sure the
grandious library and arcane college of \emph{Fes el-Bashir}, the towering
cliff side castle of \emph{Forsby} or the endless riches in art and music of
\emph{Nen-Hilith} surely will make a lasting impression.

\section{Additional Foreword by Aren Fel}

My good old friend Graham is right in one aspect: Aror has an insidious
way of sneaking into your heart, embedding itself so deeply that not
even a Dryad could convince the roots to leave you. But he is wrong in
so many other things. The ale has not gotten better, and the people
are still unfriendly. But much has changed since the almost 1000 years
this book was originally published. Gods have vanished, civilisations
have fallen, generations have been born and have died; and most important
of all - cultures, languages and entire epochs have been lost only to be
rediscovered centuries later.

I, Aren Fel, have done my best to adapt, change and translate the
book, so that the work of my good friend continues as he originally
intended: as an useful guide to our world, both past and present. In
many ways the book has now exceeded its original purpose. It was once
a mere introduction to Aror, but it is now also a chronicle of our
history. A lens into our past, and perhaps a warning for our future.

Be safe adventurer, and fasten this book to your belt for easy access,
in case any blind cannibalistic humanoids chase you through a cavern.
