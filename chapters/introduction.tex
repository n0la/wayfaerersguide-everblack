\chapter{Everblack Campaign Setting}

The \emph{Everblack} campaign setting is a D\&D setting for 3.5e.  It is
written from the view of the two most prominent NPCs of the world:
\nameref{sec:Graham Balance} an influential archmagi and bard, and
\nameref{sec:Aren Fel} the undying witch, a chronicler, follower of the
\nameref{sec:Silent Queen}, and a potent figure in the history of the
world.

It is in fact a labour of love of one person, with input from many different
people and players. It was started in 2015 and continuously enhanced and
refined over the course of many years.

This campaign setting contains adult content, and should not be perused by
those faint of heart or soul.

\section{Tone of Everblack}

One of the main defining features of \emph{Everblack} is the tone and attitude
of the campaign setting. It combines traditional fantasy settings, with a love
for horror, and a more european centric lore. It also aims to introduce grit,
moral ambiguity, shades of gray and an everlasting fear of death. Although
\emph{Dark Sun} already does many of these aspects extra ordinarily well
already, \emph{Everblack} does not rely on a post-apocalyptic surrounding.
It's just that in \emph{Everblack} everything tries to eat, kill or enslave
you while you can also sniff pretty flowers on the side of the road. However
this does not mean that good does not exist in this world. Like spices in
cooking, you can overdo gritty and dark concepts in a work of fiction.

The world of \nameref{sec:Aror} is old, and rich in history. Filled with
ancient legends, gods long dead, and civilisations that have long been lost.
Those that venture outside the save walls of the major city kingdoms, will
find strange creatures, obscure cults, death and peril, but also adventures,
powerful artefacts and great riches.

Magic is a major part of the setting, and is augmented by a new, and fourth
form of magic: \nameref{sec:Soul Magic}. While in \emph{Everblack} both arcane
and divine magic come from the gods, \emph{soul magic} is inherent to every
living being, much like psionic powers. However \emph{soul magic} is often
misunderstood, shunned and even forbidden by the followers of the lesser gods.

But still the world of \emph{Everblack} is a place where adventurers set forth
to slay the beast and bring back the gold. A world full of magic, ancient
artifacts, but also of eldritch horrors, great strife and despair.

\section{Some things you should know}

\begin{enumerate}
 \litem{Not everything within D\&D fits} Many creatures, concepts, classes and
 races that are part of the basic D\&D do not fit into \emph{Everblack}. Some
 monsters may be extinct, classes might be rarer, or non-existant in
 \emph{Everblack} (such as the traditional 3.5e monk), and some concepts do
 not directly fit within the world itself. While this might bar you from
 certain concepts and mechanics, this was done deliberately to enhance the
 tone, and atmosphere of the campaign setting.

 \litem{Overall tone} \emph{Everblack} attempts to blend horror and low fantasy
 with D\&D. While it is not as ``grim dark'' as other settings, it attempts to
 capture the harsh realities of a time long past, where slavery is common place,
 your village might get raided and destroyed solely because of a feud that is
 millennia old, and were ancient \nameref{sec:Daemons} meddle in the affairs
 of mortals. Powerful spells are rare, and magic is unreliable in the presence
 of \nameref{sec:Everblack}. At least \nameref{sec:Vampires} are your friends.

 \litem{Soul Magic} The setting introduces a new, fourth kind of magic to the
 world: \nameref{sec:Soul Magic}. It postulates that every living being has a
 soul, from which the being can draw power from. This power might enhance
 martial abilities or may be directly shaped into magic spells. Arcane and
 divine magic comes directly from the gods, and they have used both as a tool
 to manipulate the mortal races for aeons. Often lesser deities see soul magic
 as an aberration, and thus manipulate their followers into seeking out and
 destroying soul magic everywhere they can find it. To those untrained in the
 arts of the soul, a person with an affliction in the soul might just be
 another undead creature, fuelling misconceptions and ignorance among the
 general populace.

 \litem{Aror is a global place} The planet of Everblack, known as Aror, has a
 few very important and big city kingdoms which are connected with each other
 with an arcane teleporter network. Although the cities charge money for the
 usage of these teleporters it has made the world smaller. Commoners, traders
 and adventurers use them regularly to visit other city kingdoms, to travel,
 do trade and exchange cultures. These teleporters are limited to large cities
 as the network requires constant care of magi and wizards to be kept
 operational.

 \litem{Everblack} The setting is named after the \nameref{sec:Everblack}
 crystal. Pitch black crystals that can store any magical energy. They are
 often used to aid casters, fuel arcane machinery, and are vital in the
 construction of magical items and trinkets. Everblack is rare, so much so
 that shards of it are used as the major currency for large purchases. The
 crystals are used in all sorts of magical research, in arcane experiments,
 and arcane machinery. It his highly sought after all across the world, and
 entire societies depend on it for mining, trade and arcane constructions.

 \litem{New Races} In addition to the common player races, \emph{Everblack}
 introduces three new races: the \nameref{sec:Deepkin}, \nameref{sec:Diarim}
 as well as the \nameref{sec:Umgeher}. Deepkin are the cavern dwelling cousins
 of the human races, with dark vision, bright white skin and flowing red
 hair. While Umgeher are a half undead species of humans that were created by
 powerful vampires a long time ago as servants. Diarim are a slave race which
 were bred by the giants for battle against their mortal enemies the dragons.

 \litem{Death means Death} Unlike many other settings death is often final
 within the world of Everblack. Only daemons can shelter a soul from being
 dissolved within the \nameref{sec:Soul Well}, and will ask a steep price for
 doing so.

 \litem{Island among the planes} A huge, and ancient device called the
 \nameref{sec:Monolith} isolates Aror from the planescape, and makes inter
 planar magic difficult, and dangerous.

 \litem{Intelligence gives choice} Any creature that is intelligent may chose
 its own alignment. This also applies to the classically ``evil'' creatures
 such as monstrous races, undead, and even devils. But don't worry, you will
 find plenty of evil to find on Aror.

 \litem{Culture above race} There are no racial states or nations on Aror, as
 the core humanoid races are almost equally distributed across the land, and
 live happily together. The place of origin defines your culture, language,
 background and perhaps even your temperament way more than your race will.

\section{Foreword by Graham Balance}

The following book should serve you well as an introduction to the
place you might only know as the place \emph{where everblack comes
  from}. I, Archmagi Graham Balance, would like you welcome you to
our corner of the multiverse: ``Aror''.

This book will serve you as a guide to Aror's many places, cultures,
customs, people and creatures. I am fortunate to have counted this
place as my home for many years, and it holds a special place in my
heart. Great was the dismay when I had to discover on my frequent
travels and journyes to other planes, that our tiny little speck of
the multiverse was not very well know, or perhaps only known as the
``place where Everblack crystals come from''. While true, it saddens
me deeply to see our fine planet, and its people, reduced to the mere
fact that we export black crystals charged with arcane energy. That
experience was the sole motivator on why I am wrote this book: To bring
our way of life to you, dear reader.

I have interviewed many that did come to Aror, and most of them only
remembered the bad things that had happened to them in their short
visit: unfriendly locals speaking weird tongues, stale ale, and the
occasional blind subterranean humanoid that tried to eat them. While
many of these aspects are true, they are warped exaggerations of the
truth. My sincere hopes are that, after reading through this book, you
have arrived at the conclusion that Aror is a place worth visiting,
that our ale is as good as any - if not better - and that the
cannibalistic blind humanoid creatures of the deep are too far and few
between to be a real threat.

You will have heard our most treasured places, such as the holy lake of
\emph{Mu'ut} in the south; the lone yet towering \emph{Goban} mountain in the
east; the endless treasures, archipelagos and beaches that the \emph{Silver
  Isles} have to offer; or the vast mountains, lush forests, and friendly
locals of \emph{Eilean Mor}. If that does not impress you, I am sure the
grandious library and arcane college of \emph{Fes el-Bashir}, the towering
cliff side castle of \emph{Forsby} or the endless riches in art and music of
\emph{Nen-Hilith} surely will make a lasting impression.

\section{Additional Foreword by Aren Fel}

My good old friend Graham is right in one aspect: Aror has an insidious
way of sneaking into your heart, embedding itself so deeply that not
even a Dryad could convince the roots to leave you. But he is wrong in
so many other things. The ale has not gotten better, and the people
are still unfriendly. But much has changed since the almost 1000 years
this book was originally published. Gods have vanished, civilisations
have fallen, generations have been born and have died; and most important
of all - cultures, languages and entire epochs have been lost only to be
rediscovered centuries later.

I, Aren Fel, have done my best to adapt, change and translate the
book, so that the work of my good friend continues as he originally
intended: as an useful guide to our world, both past and present. In
many ways the book has now exceeded its original purpose. It was once
a mere introduction to Aror, but it is now also a chronicle of our
history. A lens into our past, and perhaps a warning for our future.

Be safe adventurer, and fasten this book to your belt for easy access,
in case any blind cannibalistic humanoids chase you through a cavern.
