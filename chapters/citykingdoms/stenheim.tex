\subsection{Stenheim}

The city kingdom of \emph{Stenheim} (also \emph{Stoahom} in deepkin dialect)
lies on the north western shores of \emph{North Goltir}, situated on the foot of
the coastal mountain range of the \emph{Aldenes}, where the \emph{Taraun}
river flows into the sea.

While the majority of the city has been built at the food of the mountain, the
castle and main fortifications reside in natural and hewn caverns in the
mountain.

\subsubsection*{History}

It was officially recognised as a city kingdom in \emph{GT:10800}, but is
considered far older. Earliest record dating back to almost \emph{GT:4000}
were found in the vault of the city, albeit it was but a small deepkin
settlement back then. It began as a small tribe, but soon the favourable
conditions of the settlements location, namely access to the shore and
fresh water from the river, attracted more and more deepkin and dark elven
clans. Unlike most of the dwarven clans that lived in the Aldenes, the deepkin
clan welcomed their surface brethren - such humans, elves and halflings - into
their deep caverns from the beginning.

The deepkin built another smaller city outside their caverns, and used it to
trade the ores and gemstones to the other nations and kingdoms. The access to
the river, the easy connection to the sea (and thus trade) and its beautiful
and scenic lake scenery attracted more and more of the surface races, and the
city grew over the course of many centuries.

\subsubsection*{Wars}

The kingdom was involved in many defensive wars over the course of its early
history. Many dwarven clans, as well as some dark elven and remnants of the
Ilian empire tried to seize the deepkin workshop for themselves.

The city, and the deepkin workshop were besieged countless times by the dwarven
clans of the Aldenes. Especially the \emph{Black Hill} dwarves, with their
friends and allies of the \emph{Snowhammer} clan often attempted to seize
the deepkin kingdom for themselves. Although these conflicts were bloody and
often set back both sides for decades, the dwarven clans were never
victorious. Now the deepkin kingdom has eclipsed all of the other mountain
clans in size, and must no longer fear the smaller clans of the mountain.

The deepkin had used their ingenuity to construct advanced war machinery such
as arcane siege weapons, arcane weapons and armour, as well as war
golems. This distinct technological advancements helped them defeat clans that
had superior forces with relative ease. This technological advancement did not
sleep, and still to this day the city kingdom is considered one of the
strongest in terms of military power, capable of fielding a highly equipped
army as well as countless combat ready golems, war and siege machinery.

Compared to many other more warring clans of the Aldenes, the deepkin never
enslaved or seized the lands of other clans. Most of the wars the deepkin
thought were defensive in nature. Their less aggressive approach, as well as
their propriety to get along, diplomatically and culturally, with the other
deep races made their kingdom an attractive destination for the other mountain
clans. Many smaller dark elven and dwarven clans mitigated to the city and
integrated well into the deepkin culture.

\subsubsection*{Population}

The outlying city of Stenheim, as well as the deepkin workshop and castle holds
roughly 19 million people, of which the majority are deepkin (39\%) and dark
elves (22\%), while dwarves (11\%), humans (10\%) and halflings (7\%) make up a
sizable minority. Due to the deepkin's liberal and welcoming nature, Stenheim
has become a destination for many half races (9\%) as well as undead (2\%).

\subsubsection*{Culture}

The deepkin of Stenheim (and by extension the other races living there as
well), are mostly atheistic. Although \emph{Forun} does have a sizeable
following within the mountain kingdom. The city mostly focuses on mining and
arcane research, and the people of Stenheim pride themselves for being a
centre for scientific and arcane learning.

Most people of the kingdom are considered humble, curious and known for their
love all things mechanical. The deepkin have shared their passion for golem
construction, mechanical and civil engineering with the other races that joined
them. Almost all people in the kingdom enjoy luxuries that no other kingdom can
offer, such as indoor plumbing and arcane light fixtures.

The culture of Stenheim is known for being one of the most liberal and
advanced of all the city kingdoms. The people enjoy a wide variety of freedoms
and liberties, as well as a fair, stable and well functioning state.

\subsubsection*{Rule}

The kingdom is run by either a patriarch or matriarch that is elected from a
council of elders, guild leaders, high ranking positions within the arcane
academy, as well as constabularies that are chose by the general
population. This ruler is then sworn in, and stays in power until his death,
abdication or until the council elects to vote for a new patriarch or
matriarch. Although not a king, the ruler of the city is deemed equal to a
king by the other city kingdoms and welcomed as such.

More unusual is the fact that the kingdom is split into smaller districts,
each ruled by a constabulary. Although these local rulers report to the
matriarch or patriarch, they hold considerable power within their district,
and are even allowed to pen local laws. They are not chosen democratically
albeit the matriarch can opt to remove a constabulary that has become
unpopular with the people.

The city's population and the majority of their rulers are against slavery,
and has also removed indentured servitude in favour of imprisonment. Convicted
criminals can still opt to reduce their sentence by mining for ore, or reduce their
sentence even further by mining for everblack. The kingdom did not sign the
\emph{Vonir Accord}, but most of their citizen are well protected from slavery
in other kingdoms as no foreign power wishes to risk a diplomatic incident with
Stenheim.

\subsubsection*{Relations}

The kingdom holds good relations with the other city kingdoms, except for
Kesmar. Stenheim often accused the dwarven kingdom for secretly aiding their
enemies during past sieges and skirmishes. Most of surrounding clans in the
mountain hold the kingdom in contempt, seeing them as an imperialistic force
with no equal in power. Even though the kingdom does not aggressively expand,
the surrounding clans and tribes are pressured into joining the city or face
becoming irrelevant next to their humongous neighbour.

Furthermore Stenheim is known for exporting both their advanced war machinery,
technology, ore and everblack to other nations. It is known for selling their
weapons and golems to anyone who are able to front the price.
