\subsection{Helmarnock}
\label{sec:Helmarnock}

The city kingdom of \emph{Helmarnock} (ancient Teranim for ``land of the
people called Helm'') lies on the south-eastern edge of \nameref{sec:Eilean
  Mor}. It is unique as the kingdom is resides on four islands as well as the
eastern shore, which were once ruled by separate five baronies that joined
together into one kingdom.

\subsubsection{Geography}

Helmarnock lies spread out on four different islands off the south eastern
shore of Eilean Mor. The islands are joined together by four huge stone
bridges, that converge in a crossroad in the middle of the sea between the
islands. The kingdom also owns land on the shores of \emph{Eilean Mor}.  The
northern island is called \emph{Temen}, the eastern island \emph{Thorm}, the
southern island \emph{Eledis} and the western island is called \emph{Saremen}.

All of the islands are covered with a sprawling urban metropolis, and the
islands are surrounded by huge harbours and ports. The land on the shore is
mainly used as farmland as the huge stream \emph{Dunast} makes the land
fertile for crops.

\subsubsection{History}

The city kingdom was founded in \emph{GT:984} when the four baronies that
ruled the islands and the shore joined together to form one big city kingdom.
The rulers of these baronies all intermarried and created a new noble family
called house \emph{Helm}. The islands were joined with bridges and a small
public forum was built in the centre of this island from which the king could
rule. However in \emph{GT:1588} the noble family ended up without an heir and
the throne became vacant.

For two hundred years the five noble families fought between each over the
throne. Although the conflict never escalated into full civil war, the houses
raided each other, abducted and assassinated important members of other
houses, as well as sabotaged companies and production facilities. These two
hundred years are now known as the \emph{bloody years}, and it deeply
entrenched itself within the population, splitting them into five major
factions. The deep trenches that divided the people of these islands then can
still be felt after hundreds of years since the conflict.

Finally in \emph{GT:1601} the dispute was settled. The noble houses decided
to not elect a new ruler, but instead rule the kingdom as a council of family
leaders. The resulting government is called the \emph{high council} and rules
the city absolute. But stability and security returned slowly to the city
kingdom over the course of many decades.

In \emph{GT:3401} the city kingdom was dragged into the \nameref{sec:Holy
  Crusade} by the vampire noble house de'Var who openly rallied against the
Holy Church of \nameref{sec:Griannar}. The other noble houses followed the war
declaration as the united \emph{kingdom of Helmarnock}. Although it cost the
kingdom many lives, it was ultimately a victory and a source of national
pride, that united the divided spirits under the banner of one greater
kingdom.

\subsubsection{Culture}

\graham{Their reputation is undeserved. For the most part.}

The citizen of Helmarnock are known to still harbour resentment for each other,
and are mostly patriotic towards their own noble family. Years of underhanded
and illegal dealings, corruption within the city guard and armies have given
the people of Helmarnock a reputation for cutting corners, being sleazy,
lacking in morals or being outright criminals. Although this does not hold
true for the vast amount of the working population; the climate of harsh
competition between the islands tends to promote ruthless and underhanded
business tactics amongst the nobility and upper class citizens.

Even though most people still divide themselves into five distinct cultures
aligned with the five noble houses, the high council is working towards
uniting the kingdom not only in government, but also in culture. The people
are encouraged to move between the islands, are encouraged to see themselves
as citizens of Helmarnock first, and then of the old baronies, and often
organise events such as festivities, plays, concerts and trade festivals in
the central forum in an attempt to unite the kingdom.

\subsubsection{House Eseriel of Tenem}
\label{sec:House Eseriel}

The northern island of Tenem is ruled by the dark elven noble House of
\emph{Eseriel}. Their banner is a red dragon upon a white background. White
and red are the main colours of the house. They operate a large shipping
enterprise and are mostly responsible for imports and exports of the
kingdom. Being natural traders and business men, House \emph{Eseriel} is the
richest among the noble houses. Members of the house are known as excellent
and reliable business partners, and often fund expensive undertakings such
as expeditions into unknown realms, large construction projects or arcane
or scientific research projects.

\subsubsection{House Onariel of Thorm}
\label{sec:House Onariel}

To the east reigns the high elven noble house of \emph{Onariel}. Their main
business is information and espionage, as well as offering counter espionage
to the entire kingdom. Their are infamous and notorious for their criminal
activities, such as smuggling, drug trafficking, espionage and oppression
of enemies of the kingdom. The bad reputation the kingdom and its citizen
have, mostly stems from various scandals that have been uncovered in which
House Onariel was involved. The house is known world wide as one of the most
effective spy organisation, that has agents and informants spread all across
the world.

Their banner is a side view of dark green owlbear in a white shield, atop of
which rests a silver crown. White and green are main colours of the house.

\subsubsection{House Kelemor of Eledis}
\label{sec:House Kelemor}

To the south rule the dwarven noble family of \emph{Kelemor}. They once
hailed from the great divide, but made their riches by building most of
the city's buildings and bridges. They operate most of the smithies and
artisan guilds of the kingdom, and often work together with House Eseriel to
export their manufactured goods to other kingdoms. They also provide the
equipment to the joint army of Helmarnock. Kelemor are often the first to call
out other houses for breaking the peace or for attempting to sabotage the
finely tuned political machinery that is the high council. Although Kelemor is
a voice for order and piece within the kingdom, they are also the fiercest
proponent for continuing slavery within the kingdom.

The house's banner is an upside down golden hammer resting on a white
background. White and gold are the main colours of their house, and their
emblem can be found on many armours, weapons they have produced and buildings
they have built throughout the kingdom.

\subsubsection{House de'Var of Saremen}
\label{sec:House deVar}

The western island is ruled by the House of \emph{de'Var}, whose mainstay
members are vampires made up from various races of \emph{Aror}. Even though
vampires generally pose a potential threat to the general populace, House
de'Var had to sign a treaty during the foundation of the kingdom to not harm
any of the kingdom's citizen, or citizens of their allied city
kingdoms. Although the idea of being ruled by vampires is scary to outsiders,
House de'Var are fair and just rulers. Their members abide by the law, and do
not feast on humanoids or monstrous citizens, instead preferring to live off
\nameref{sec:Ramesk}, a mineral rich fluid invented by the Ilians, as a blood
substitute. The liquid also allows the vampires of House de'Var to endure the
sunlight for a limited amount of time, albeit they only wander the streets in
daylight with protective clothing.

The house also provides the city guard and justice system for the entire
kingdom, and is paid for this service by the other houses. The island of
Saremen also houses the kingdom's library and arcane institution. Despite
having an obvious reason to be for slavery, de'Var is openly against it. They
do not require slaves for nourishment, and even if they were to feast upon
them, they'd lose both respect and renown within the very population they try
to rule. The vampires of the house see themselves as effective and just
rulers, since they do not tire, become ill or clouded in judgement, and thus
wish to proof that very fact to their subjects.

Together with \nameref{sec:House Onariel}, House of de'Var runs a few dedicated
prisons, safe houses and temples around the world with the sole purpose of
rehabilitating feral vampires. House Thorm offers their information gathering
skills to find and track nests of feral vampires, while members of House
de'Var capture these feral vampires and try to rehabilitate them by force
feeding them Ramesk. These vampires are then further trained and tutored on
how to become a productive member of a humanoid societies, often with great
success. This brings House de'Var often in conflict with the knights of
\nameref{sec:Lor} or the \nameref{sec:Nightwatch}.

House de'Var was also responsible for creating the race \nameref{sec:Umgeher}
in \emph{MI:263}. In their hubris, they attempted to create the perfect
``undead citizen''. Those were supposed to be used as soldiers, guards,
workers and labourers. However the Umgeher were poorly received by the
population. Mostly because deceased citizens were used in the process, and
many found their deceased loved ones among the new workforce. Many workers
feared that the undead would replace them, stripping them of their lively hood
and ability to feed their own families. The people of Saremen demanded that
the Umgeher should be exiled from their kingdom. Out of fear of upsetting
their population any further, house de'Var gave the Umgeher the gift of
reproduction and exiled them from the city. The exile was lifted in
\emph{MI:1122}.

The house's banner shows a blue raven, flying downward upon a white
background. Blue and white are the main colours of the house.

\subsubsection{House Liares}
\label{sec:House Liares}

The human house \emph{Liares} rules the territories on the shores and main
land of Eilean Mor. Although they are the smallest house of nobility in
Helmarnock, they are one of the most important. They own the vast majority of
farms on the mainland and are vitally important both to provide and produce
the food for the islands, as well as for growing the roots and herbs required
to brew \nameref{sec:Ramesk}, the blood substitution drink for the
vampires. House Liares are also responsible for maintaining good relations
with the other city kingdoms, and thus run embassies and provide ambassadors.

House Liares' banner is a black tree upon white background. White and black
are their main colours.

\subsubsection{Banner}

The banner of Helmarnock is a shield upon white background, divided into five
section. Each section bears the banner of one the five houses. Top left the
red dragon of Eseriel, top right the owlbear of Onariel, middle right the
golden hammer of Kelemor, at the bottom the tree of Liares, and middle left
the raven of de'Var.

\subsubsection{Population}

The kingdom is a sprawling metropolis, housing roughly 18 million people on
all four islands and the mainland. Most numerous are the various kinds of
elves (38\%) followed by humans (31\%) and dwarves (28\%) with the half
races, Umgeher and Diarim making up a small minority (3\%).

Vampires, Diarim and Umgeher are allowed to become citizens, so are all of the
half races, including Gorgons. Monstrous races are allowed in the city, but
are not allowed to become official citizens.

Common male names are: Abban, Aidan, Angus, Bran, Brian, Cian, Cinaed, Dara,
Edan, Farquhar, Fearghas, Finn, Geralt, Kilian, Neil, Rian, Sean, Teige, Ulick

Common female names are: Ailis, Ailsin, Aoibhe, Bree, Cait, Cliodhna, Deirdre,
Eileen, Eilish, Fiadh, Fiona, Lean, Lile, Maeve, Moyra, Rose, Shea, Siobhan

\subsubsection{Society}

Although the high council rules supreme, each historical barony (so each
island and the main land) has a local government whose main task is to
administer the parts of the kingdom, as well as enforcing laws enacted by the
high council. Slavery is allowed within most of the city - except for Saremen
- however slaves do have some rights. For example a slave owner must take
care, feed and clothe a slave, and a slave owner who intentionally lets a
slave starve is charged with murder. \hyperref[sec:Indentured
  Servitude]{indentured servitude} is quite common, mostly as a way to
compensate victims of crimes by forcing the perpetrator to work off his debts
or fine if they are unable to pay them. The houses of Eseriel, Kelemor and
Liares are main proponents of slavery as they profit most from the free
labour. House de'Var is a fierce opponent of slavery, but find themselves
alone in that position.

\subsubsection{Academy of Arcane Arts}
\label{sec:Academy of Arcane Arts}

Helmarnock is also known around the world for being a generous patron of the
arcane arts and sciences. The academy resides on the island of \emph{Saremen}
and is mainly funded by house de'Var and house Eseriel. It is both famous,
and infamous, for teaching and researching necromancy. The academy not only
studies and teaches the arcane arts but also most major sciences such as
medicine, physics and astronomy.

\subsubsection{Expeditionary Force}
\label{sec:Expeditionary Force}

The mainstay armies of Helmarnock are called the Helmarnock Expeditionary
Forces (often simply abbreviated ``the forces''). It recruits both from within
the kingdom, but also from people from outside. Foreigners who join the forces
for at least five years receive special consideration when they apply for
citizenship within the kingdom. Many foreigners join as the expeditionary
forces have a reputation for being a well trained, equipped and capable, who
also pay fair wages and compensation to families in case of death or injury.

\subsubsection{Relations}

Due to the widespread acceptance of law-abiding undead throughout the city,
the kingdom has no, or bad relations with most religions and churches that see
undead as an affront to the natural order. Among these are the
\nameref{sec:Five Holy Orders}, the \nameref{sec:Holy Church of Aleaste} (even
though Aleaste was of House Eseriel) and the various churches and knight
orders of \nameref{sec:Lor}. This rivalry has often cumulated in skirmishes
between the city kingdom and the knight orders, but neither side risks an all
out war.

Helmarnock has signed the \nameref{sec:Vonir Accord} with Norbury, and is also
one of Norbury's closest allies.
