\subsection{Morkan}
\label{sec:Morkan}

\aren{Oh Ishmael, thy weakness caused so much tragedy and death.}

\emph{Morkan} (old Teranim for ``beacon'') is a city kingdom on the south
eastern shores of \nameref{sec:Iafandir}. It often referred to as the northern
or simply the tyrant kingdom.

\subsubsection{History}

The youngest city kingdom of them all, it was founded in \emph{MI:1938} by
Xian, a human warrior and barbarian native to Iâfandir. He gathered support
for a campaign into towards Iâfandir in \nameref{sec:Hraglund} and
\nameref{sec:Norbury} to establish a human settlement and military outpost in
the rather inhospitable lands of the beast races. Especially in Norbury his
plan of another military outpost against the invasion was well received and
liked among both nobility and the general populace. He sailed from the shores
of Norbury with his friends and allies \emph{Arissa} and \emph{Taras} in
\emph{MI:1930}. It took Xian eight years to build a small settlement, as well
as bringing most of the local tribes of his new land under his reign. But in
\emph{MI:1938} Norbury officially supported and endorsed the foundation of a
new monarchy, ruling over the city kingdom of Morkan.

Xias ruled just, and preferred inviting and integrating tribes, rather than
conquering them. Most of the local tribes were humanoid, and many of his
followers from Norbury supported that decision. But when Xias peacefully
integrated non humanoid races, namely a tribe of trolls and ogres, his
popularity waned within his own kingdom. Taras openly opposed him, claiming
that beast races had no place within city kingdoms. In \emph{MI:1942} an
altercation between dwarves and ogres escalated into a short civil conflict,
costing the lives of almost 400 citizens. Xian, still insisted on finding a
peaceful solution to the problem, lost the majority of his power in a coup to
\emph{Taras} who proclaimed himself ``steward''. Taras continued to
consolidate his power in the royal court, and also gained the support of the
humanoid population by forcing the ogres into exile.

The ogres were forcefully and violently driven from the town in the winter of
\emph{MI:1942}, and many of the tribe - especially weaker ogres such as the
elderly, women and children - starved or froze to death during the exodus. Even
though the trolls were innocent in this altercation they supported the ogres,
leaving the town along with them. Xian, with his position of power now
severely weakened, found himself on the throne without any real power. His
fate as a ruler was sealed, when in the spring of \emph{MI:1943} the tribe of
ogres and troll returned to lay siege upon the city. 

\subsubsection{Absolute reign of Taras}

The ogres and trolls laid siege the small kingdom of Morkan for several
months. And although the kingdom withstood, the small nation was brought to
the brink of collapse. Taras was sent forth to secure aid from Norbury, while
Arissa and Xian tried to break the siege. Unbeknownst to Taras, they attempted
to break the siege through diplomacy. During the summer of \emph{MI:1943} Xian
had secured peace with the trolls and ogres through diplomatic means, and
called Taras home. However Taras returned with an army of volunteers from
Norbury and rejected the peace treaty. Still promised the support of large
portion of the populace, Taras broke the siege forcefully killing most of the
ogres and trolls, while enslaving the rest. His popularity soared after the
victory, and he had Xian and Arissa arrested for high treason.

\subsubsection{A new ruler}

Taras outlawed all beast races from the city kingdom, instituted slavery,
and turned his gaze outward. He proposed a new plan for Iâfandir: make it free
of beast races that would otherwise go forth and raid Eilean Mor and terrorise
peaceful and innocent humanoids in the process. And in turn return the newly
conquered land to those humanoid races to farm and settle upon. Although many
moderates disagreed with him and returned to Norbury, their word of mouth
attracted the radical hard-liners that found Norbury's policy of defence
insufficient or even a weakness.

Taras continued to reign absolute in the small northern kingdom. In
\emph{MI:1988} it was revealed that Taras had achieved \emph{lich-dom},
potentially sealing his reign of the kingdom for eternity.

\subsubsection{Beast wars}

Taras formed two new armies: the \emph{red legion} and the \emph{iron
  hand}, and set them loose upon the continent to enact his plan. Morkan is
engaged in a never ending genocidal campaign against any non-humanoid beast
races (such as ogres, trolls, harpies) while offering sanctuary to humanoid
species (such as pale elves or the northern human barbarian tribes). The
campaign of massacres, genocides and massive enslavement of the tribes and
species of the continent became known as the \emph{beast wars}. The armies of
Morkan move further west with each passing year, forcing all other tribes
to flee westward. Some tribes have tried to flee across the ocean toward
Eilean Mor, but are intercepted - and often slaughtered - upon the high sea
by Norbury. As of \emph{MI:2022} this campaign has been going on for almost
eighty years, without any end in sight.

\subsubsection{Banner}

The kingdom of Morkan has a red, and white banner with a large golden grown
nested in the middle of a shield. Red and white are the main colours of
Morkan.

\subsubsection{Growth and Prosperity}

Over the course of decades Taras shaped the city kingdom of Morkan into a
prosperous, huge self reliant city kingdom. Although the continent was harsh
and lacking fertile farmland, he built the wealth of the kingdom by exporting
precious minerals and slaves. By \emph{MI:2000} it had roughly 490000
registered citizens, and uncountable number of slaves. Most of the citizens
were humans and dwarves, with elves being in the minority.

\subsubsection{Culture}

Morkan is a tyrannical, fascistic regime that actively represses any dissident
within its own population. Youth are brainwashed at an early age to support
the kingdom's goals of the \emph{beast wars}. Citizens of Morkan see
themselves, and the pure humanoid races, as the true rulers of \emph{Aror} and
have great disdain for all beast races and even half humanoid, half beast races
(which they call \emph{mongrel races}).

The average Morkan is patriotic, militaristic and heavily aligned with the
ideals of the kingdom. Art, song and creative enterprises have no place within
Morkan, unless it furthers the kingdom's narrative of racial supremacy. However
Taras promotes a culture and idolised ``citizen of Morkan'': A person who is
orderly, hard working, conscientious always ready to pick up a sword to defend
king and country, and to whom family, camaraderie is as important as the
``common goal'' of the empire.

Foreigners are often greeted with mistrust, as they are often seen as
``spies'' from foreign powers, trying to undermine the righteous path of
Morkan. Visitors must expect to be under constant surveillance while staying
in the kingdom, as well as having any business dealings put under intense
scrutiny.

\subsubsection{Laws}

\emph{Taras} rules supreme, and not even his \emph{aspects} (generals,
advisers and representatives) dare to speak against his word. Slavery is
allowed, as well as enforced upon beast races and those deemed of ``impure''
blood, criminals and citizens. Slaves have no rights, no freedoms, and are
often sold for profit to other city kingdoms.

A secret police called the \emph{Kaltar} silences dissident movements and
resistance cells both outside and within Morkan. They are known to torture and
abduct people, as well as spy on the general populace to obtain their
information. The Kaltar are only responsible for anti-government crimes, while
the \emph{Inquisition} handled criminal and civil law cases. Citizens of
Morkan can expect a reasonably fair trial, unless their crimes include treason
or anti-government activities.

\subsubsection{Aspects}

\aren{The aspects are Taras' phylacteries. Just a hunch, but I am rarely wrong
  in these matters.}

Taras appointed various high ranking officials with to be his \emph{aspects}.
He claimed that these aspects are a mere extension of his will, and thus
entrusted them with a specific task within the kingdom.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Arissa}, the \emph{Aspect of Shadow}. The elven rogue Arissa
    returned from her imprisonment in \emph{MI:1978} openly denouncing the
    actions of Xian, and joining the kingdom at Taras' side as an aspect of
    his rule. She oversees the \emph{Kaltar}, the secret police and spy
    organisation of Morkan.

  \item \textbf{Torem}, the \emph{Aspect of War}, a human barbarian leads the
    \emph{Red Legion}, the kingdoms main fighting force. A brutal, and savage
    slaughterer of thousands, but also a brilliant tactician and general.

  \item \textbf{Eilane}, the \emph{Aspect of Law}, a snow elven diplomat and
    wizard. She oversees the Inquisitors, a small but effective army of judges
    and executioners. She is responsible for enforcing Taras' civil law both
    within Morkan and in the newly conquered regions.

  \item \textbf{Karim}, the \emph{Aspect of Purity} is a dwarven cleric of the
    church of Morkan. He's mainly responsible for leading the kingdom in
    spiritual matters, as well as spreading the church of Morkan among the
    newly conquered territories.

  \item \textbf{Telena}, the \emph{Aspect of Truth}, is a human sorceress. She
    is responsible for the internal propaganda of the kingdom. She is also
    directly responsible for the diplomatic relations with other city kingdoms
    and nations.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cult of personality}

One by one Taras outlawed the other religions in Morkan. He replaced them with
a \emph{Church of Morkan}, a religious institution headed by \emph{Karim} the
aspect of purity. In the canon Taras himself is praised as the divine
incarnation of the will of his people to bring peace and purity upon the
land. Membership in the church is mandatory for citizens, and so are the daily
masses that are held at midday. Scholars do not know how or why, but priests
and paladins of the church of Morkan are granted divine spells and power. It
is still an unsolved mystery how Taras accomplishes this feat, as he is the
sole deity worshipped by the Church of Morkan.

\subsubsection{Iron Hand}
\label{sec:Iron Hand}

The \emph{Iron Hand} are the elite soldiers of Morkan. Heavily armed, armoured
and well equipped with magical equipment they partake in the conflicts of the
beast wars as necessary, but are also the personal guard of Taras himself. They
are picked from the best of the best of the \emph{Red Legion} and also trained
in special operations. For many, there is no greater honour than to serve as
personal guards to Taras himself.

\subsubsection{Red Legion}
\label{sec:Red Legion}

The \emph{Red Legion} is the main stay army of Morkan. It is known for its
fierceness and brutality in battle, as well as for its cruelty it inflicts
upon captured towns and villages. All subjects of Morkan must complete a
three year service within the red legion to attain citizenship status. Humanoid
slaves must complete a ten year service within the legion before they are
granted citizenship status.

The legion takes able bodied humanoid men and women from towns they
capture, while killing the rest. Those that show promise as fighters are
recruited, while the rest are enslaved. They are also tasked with enacting the
\emph{degree of purity}, the genocide of beast races, upon Iâfandir.

A sizeable amount of legionaires were also sent to fight with the coalition
against the \hyperref[sec:Devil Siege]{devil invaders of Forsby}. Although
less organised and disciplined than its counter part armies, it proved itself
as a strong and ruthless fighting force in the face of a superior enemy.

\subsubsection{Kaltar}

The \emph{Kaltar} (old Teranim for ``owl'') is the secret police of
Morkan. Lead by the Arissa the aspect of shadow, it is tasked with finding and
eradicating dissident movements, traitors and enemies of the state.  It
achieves this goal with a vast network of civil informants, highly trained
spies and field operatives, and various outposts all over the world that help
it enact Tara's will outside of the city gates. The \emph{Kaltar} are feared
all over the kingdom for abducting, torturing and murdering everyone they
suspect of undermining the rightful rule of Taras.

\subsubsection{Relations}

Morkan has only one true ally: Norbury. All other city kingdoms paused their
diplomatic relations with the kingdom after the beast wars began.  The kingdom
of Morkan is a signer of the \emph{Vonir Accord}.

It is an open secret that Norbury trades heavily with Morkan. In exchange for
slaves, iron and copper, Norbury sends massive amounts of food and medicine to
its northern neighbour. The rapid and aggressive expansion, combined with a
scorched earth policy, and a heavy governmental focus on warfare has made
Morkan highly dependant on the aid of Norbury to be able to feed its own
population.
