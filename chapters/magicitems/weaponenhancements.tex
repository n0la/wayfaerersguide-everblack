\begin{35e}{Weapon Absorption}
  \emph{Weapon Absorption} is an enhancement that can be added to any light
  weapon. The weapon is bonded to a particular wearer, and that wearer may
  store and retrieve the weapon from and to his forearm at will as a free
  action. The weapon leaves a visible tattoo upon the wearer's forearm,
  symbolising the nature of the weapon (i.e. a dagger symbol for a dagger, or
  a small hammer for a light hammer). The weapon returns to the wearers
  forearm if the wearer loses contact with it, and a person may only store one
  weapon per forearm. Once a bond between a weapon and a wearer has been
  established, the wearer cannot part with the weapon. A \emph{Remove Curse}
  spell is required to unbind the weapon from the chosen wearer. A weapon
  with this enhancement which does not have a current dedicated wearer, will
  automatically bond with the first person that directly touches the weapon.
  An intelligent weapon can resist bonding, as well as being absorbed or drawn
  from the wearer.
