\section{Artefacts}
\label{sec:Artefacts}

The world of Aror is filled with various magical artefacts, some crafted by
artisans with knowledge now long lost to civilisation. Other artefacts are
only rumoured to exist, while some might have been forgotten altogether. This
is \emph{not} a collector's grade book on the hundreds, if not thousands, of
Arorian artefacts, but it only lists those that are definitely known to exist,
and that are important to the contents of this book.
