\subsection{Dagger of the Order}
\label{sec:Dagger of the Order}

Each member of the \nameref{sec:Four Holy Orders} as well as those of the
\nameref{sec:Holy Church of Aleaste} receive a magically enhanced dagger
during their anointment ritual. It represents their membership and dedicated
to their order or church. This ceremonial dagger is a \emph{masterwork dagger}
of appropriate size for the species, and has been enhanced using the
\hyperref[sec:Weapon Absorption]{weapon absorption} enhancement. The dagger
has also been blessed by priests of the order and can thus be used as a focus
for divine spells.

Many priests only use the dagger as a holy focus or for ceremonial purposes,
while knights, paladins, fighters and agents of the order actively use it
in combat. Many embellish, enhance, engrave or otherwise personalise the
dagger to make it better suitable for their needs.
