\subsection{Dagger of the Order}
\label{sec:Dagger of the Order}

Each member of the \nameref{sec:Four Holy Orders} receives a magically
enhanced dagger during their anointment ritual that represents their
membership and dedicated to their order. This ceremonial dagger is a
\emph{masterwork dagger} of appropriate size for the species. It has
been enhanced using the \hyperref[sec:Weapon Absorption]{weapon absorption}
enhancement. The dagger has also been blessed by priests of the order
and can thus be used as a focus for divine spells.

Many priests only use the dagger has a holy focus or for ceremonial purposes,
while knights, paladins, fighters and agents of the order actively use it
in combat. Many embellish, enhance, engrave or otherwise personalise the
dagger to make it better suitable for their needs.
