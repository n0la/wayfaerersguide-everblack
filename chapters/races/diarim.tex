\subsection{Diarim}
\label{sec:Diarim}

\aren{The expression \emph{explaining freedom to a Diarim} has become
ingrained in many cultures as a metaphor for a fruitless labour.}

The \emph{Diarim} are a race of humanoid creatures that were bread for
specific tasks by the dark sorcerers and witches of the giants living on the
continent of \emph{Farlar}. They are the youngest of the races on \emph{Aror},
and are a mixture of various other humanoid races.

\emph{Diarim} come in in as many shapes and sizes as the giants had uses and
tasks for their engineered slave race. But most share a common set of features:
the light, fair skin of the \emph{Deepkin}, blue hair of the \emph{Snow elves},
and an ingrained sense of duty and loyalty to strict hierarchies from the
dwarves. Very few \emph{Diarim} ever escape the slavery of their masters, and
those few that do, find it hard to shake their eagerness to serve, please and
help that the giants have ingrained into them. Almost all have blue tribal
tattoos all over their body, which identify the current and past owners of the
individual \emph{diarim}.

The most common variant are labourers, small but stout breed, that was created
by introducing more dwarven heritage into the \emph{diarim}. They excel at
physical labour, such as mining and construction. Siegers were bread with
monstrous races, often even giants, and are used as front line soldiers,
gladiators and shock troops. They are larger than any other \emph{diarim}, and
often also serve as slave overseers over the others. Exciters were bred and
selected for their beauty, and are priced possessions to be traded and gifted
to other giants. Their primary role is to entertain their overlords through
song, dance and company.

Most \emph{diarim} have no names. They never refer to themselves with names,
and are only being given a names by the giants if they have distinguished
themselves, either through heroic deeds, or through crimes.

In the recent decades more and more \emph{diarim} have escaped the continent
of \emph{Farlar} and joined the other humanoid races. The giants had to learn
that you cannot suppress the curiosity, love for wandering and freedom for long
when you create a species based on humans, halflings and elves.
