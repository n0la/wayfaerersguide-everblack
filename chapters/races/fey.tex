\subsubsection{Fey}
\label{sec:Fey}

Fey are magical and evil forest spirits that were created by the
earliest \hyperref[sec:Druids]{druids} to protect nature from
destruction. During the \nameref{sec:Strife}, both monstrous and humanoid
culture uprooted forests, cleared grassland, dried marshland or outright
destroyed or corrupted nature to fuel their war machinery and ever growing
populations.

Druids, from both sides of the war, desperate to preserve nature created
forest spirits that should serve as protectors of nature. But after the druids
realised that the gentle spirits they had created proofed ineffective in
deterring the humanoid and monstrous loggers, they used necromancy to corrupt
these spirits into evil and sadistic creatures.

The fey are now universally hated and feared, and are often the cause for
great disasters, tragedies and destruction in both humanoid and monstrous
villages and communities. Their madness has clouded their judgement, and fey
attack anyone who ventures into their forests, even druids.

The most common fey are \emph{red caps}, small vicious and sadistic
human-like creatures that hunt and murder for nourishment.

Dryads attack loggers and travellers that seek the shade of the tree they are
meant to protect. Originally created merely as a beautiful illusion to woo
loggers into leaving trees unharmed, they were soon made flesh after loggers
realised they were nothing but illusions. They feast upon living flesh, and
sacrifice all those they catch to the very tree they inhabit.

Nymphs and Irrlichter seek to lure people into a marshy death by luring them
into the forest with illusions. Nymphs, much like dryads, do so by preying on
the weaker will of men, who in the early years made up the bulk of the work
force working on uprooting forests and draining swamps.

Satyrs were made to emulate the tribal patterns of the humanoid and monstrous
races and build their own villages. From there, they venture forth to raid and
pillage other villages and towns. They are capable of forging steel, and are
expert hunters and trackers. They are often aided by evil sprites and pixies,
that support the satyrs with their inherent magical abilities. Sprites and
pixies are in turn corrupted souls and spirits.

\begin{35e}{Fey}
  Everblack fey do not vanish upon death, they simply die like any other
  mortal creature. All fey that are \emph{good}, move their alignment towards
  \emph{evil}. Most of them either serve druids unwillingly, or roam the
  forests, plains and mountains seeking wreak havoc on the monstrous and
  humanoid creatures alike.

  An \emph{Irrlicht} has the same statistics as a will-o-wisp, but are of
  type \emph{Fey} instead.
