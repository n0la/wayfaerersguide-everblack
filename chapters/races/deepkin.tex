\subsection{Deepkin}
\label{sec:Deepkin}

\aren{I had the misfortune of seeing my people's decline with my own eyes.
I was powerless, and unable to stop it. We are but a shadow of our former
selves...}

\graham{But still you live. And once the time is right, you may reclaim what
once was.}

The \emph{deepkin} are the cavern dwelling cousins of humans. They are capable
of seeing in the dark (albeit without perceiving colour), and have silvery to
white pale skin, red to brownish hair, and either red, green, blue or yellow
eyes.

Deepkin society is one of the older societies on \emph{Aror}, with a long
standing history in the arcane arts, building magnificent underground cities,
libraries and workshops. Ancient deepkin were master arcane smiths, golem
constructors, and inventors of many magic contraptions and technology still
used today.

The ancient deepkin had their dominance challenged by the other races of the
deep, namely the dwarves, dark elves, and a now almost extinct species called
the \nameref{sec:Ilians}. Hundreds of years of conflicts lead to the decline
of most of their impressive civilisations. Instead of perishing however, most
of them fled to the surface, where they were warmly received by their surface
cousins. Nowadays deepkin culture is but a shadow of what it was, although
they still try to reclaim what was once theirs with expeditions into the
deep. Albeit they were well known city and kingdom builders, only one deepkin
settlement rose to the rank of a formidable city kingdom: \emph{Stenheim}.

Deepkin are treated as their own race, but are very close to their cousins the
humans in shape, features, and build.
