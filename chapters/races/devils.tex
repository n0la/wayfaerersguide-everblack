\subsection{Devils}
\label{sec:Devils}

Devils are a race of monstrous creatures that descent from the original
\hyperref[sec:Demons]{demons} that attacked \nameref{sec:Aurelis}. The aurelis
themselves freed some of the demons from their psionic overlord the
\nameref{sec:Scourge}, giving them their own free will and freedom.

After refusing to aid the Aurelis in their war, the devils have since
retreated to their own plane called \emph{layers of hell}. There they began to
establish their own society. Within devil society the most powerful and strong
rule, and the weaker devils are mercilessly oppressed through violence and
fear. Devils live in a strict hierarchy of power, and must obey their
superiors without question.

Because of the process that freed them from the enslavement of the scourge,
they have lost all their psionic powers, and now rely on arcane magic to
increase their power. Since they are the youngest of the extra planar races
and thus lack in power and might, they often offer their services through
deals to mortal races in exchange for magical artefacts or knowledge. Devils
are known to be devious, intelligent, but often quite blunt and honest in
their dealings.

Nevertheless the devils have had ample time to tinker with their own
physiology. While some devils still remain similar to their original demon
form, some have been changed drastically. The scourge seed carriers have been
exterminated, and new devils have been breed to complement the layers of hell.
They bolster their ranks also with corrupted versions of other realms.

\subsubsection{Layers of Hell}
\label{sec:Layers of Hell}

The devil's home plane is called ``layers of hell'', and is very similar to
the \nameref{sec:Abyss}. It is a hot, inhospitable, geologically unstable
planet, but nevertheless has a breathable atmosphere, and even some native
wildlife. The devils darkened the sky, blocking out the sun light with a thick
layer of dust and clouds.

\subsubsection{Generals of Hell}

The layers of hell are ruled by the supreme general \emph{Baphomet}, a large
pit fiend. He rules hell, and all its subjects with supreme power of a
tyrant. He is aided by his generals, that oversee parts of the layers of
hell on his behest. He rarely communicates with mortals, instead sending his
generals and minions to do his bidding.

\emph{Lilith}, often called the \emph{whore of babel}, rules over the first
layer of hell called babel. She rules over several legions of devils, and
fallen \hyperref[sec:Aurelis]{aurelis} that are called \emph{erinyes}. She is
only interested in striking deals with powerful mortals, and will thus tempt
kings, lords, arch mages and rich business owners. She is also responsible for
defending hell from invaders, along with Belial. Lilith has a female succubus
called \emph{Eris} as a familiar, and closest ally. Lilith rarely speaks to
anyone directly, instead sending Eris, or one of her succubi to do the talking
instead.

\emph{Asmoday} is the hellish treasurer, and responsible for retrieving,
cataloguing and studying arcane artefacts for their power. He does not deal
with mortals, and prefers to outsource the retrieval of artefacts to other
generals instead. It is believed that the vault of Asmoday contains untold
treasures and artefacts of immense power.

\emph{Belial} is the main commander of the armies of hell. As a horned devil,
he commands all the lesser forces of hell, such as the armies of bearded,
chain and bone devils, as well as several legions of orthons. He is
responsible for the defence of hell, as well as fighting the layers many
enemies, such as the \nameref{sec:Aurelis} and the \emph{sec:Demons}.

\emph{Alis} is a former succubus that prefers to use a female form close to a
human. She is responsible for striking deals with mortals, and is known for
being cunning, intelligent, ruthless but also fair and honest. She strikes
deals with mortals for powerful artefacts and knowledge, and offers the
services of hell in exchange. She, and her legions of succubi and incubi
negotiators also offer services as neutral arbitrators, councillors and
lawyers. She is the weakest of all generals.

\begin{35e}{Devils}
  Devil society is \emph{lawful evil} as a whole, but devils may be of any
  evil or neutral alignment. Succubus and incubi (as listed under demons),
  also exist among devils, as all devils are mere descendants of demons.
