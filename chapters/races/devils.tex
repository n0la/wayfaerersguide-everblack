\subsection{Devils}
\label{sec:Devils}

Devils are a race of monstrous creatures that descent from the original
\hyperref[sec:Demons]{demons} that attacked \nameref{sec:Aurelis}. The aurelis
themselves freed some of the demons from their psionic overlord the
\nameref{sec:Scourge}, giving them their own free will and freedom.

After refusing to aid the Aurelis in their war, the devils have since
retreated to their own plane called \emph{layers of hell}. There they began to
establish their own society. Within devil society the most powerful and strong
rule, and the weaker devils are mercilessly oppressed through violence and
fear. Devils live in a strict hierarchy of power, and must obey their
superiors without question.

Because of the process that freed them from the enslavement of the scourge,
they have lost all their psionic powers, and now rely on arcane magic to
increase their power. Since they are the youngest of the extra planar races
and thus lack in power and might, they often offer their services through
deals to mortal races in exchange for magical artefacts or knowledge. Devils
are known to be devious, intelligent, but often quite blunt and honest in
their dealings.

Nevertheless the devils have had ample time to tinker with their own
physiology. While some devils still remain similar to their original demon
form, some have been changed drastically. The scourge seed carriers have been
exterminated, and new devils have been breed to complement the layers of hell.
They bolster their ranks also with corrupted versions of other realms.

\subsubsection{Layers of Hell}
\label{sec:Layers of Hell}

The devil's home plane is called ``hell'', and is very similar to the
\nameref{sec:Abyss}. It is a hot, inhospitable, geologically unstable planet,
but nevertheless has a breathable atmosphere, and even some native
wildlife. The devils darkened the sky, blocking out the sun light with a thick
layer of dust and clouds.

Most creatures and devils of hell live underground in a vast network of
caverns, ravines, clefts and caves. These structures are called ``layers of
hell''. The social structure of the devils is represented in these layers.
More powerful devils live deeper down in these layers, that also become
gradually more dangerous and hotter.

The layers are also roamed by other dangerous creatures, such as
\emph{bezekira}, humanoids that have landed in hell and attempt to survive,
or \hyperref[sec:monster:Hellfire Spirit]{hellfire spirits}.

\subsubsection{Baphomet}
\label{sec:Baphomet}

The layers of hell are ruled by the supreme general \emph{Baphomet}, a large
pit fiend. He rules hell, and all its subjects with supreme power of a
tyrant. He is aided by his generals, that oversee parts of the layers of
hell on his behest. He rarely communicates with mortals, instead sending his
generals and minions to do his bidding. He also rarely leaves hell itself,
preferring to rule from afar through his direct minions or generals.

\subsubsection{Lilith}

\nameref{sec:Lilith}, often called the \emph{scarlet whore}, rules over the
surface of hell. She rules over several legions of devils, and fallen
\hyperref[sec:Aurelis]{aurelis} that are called \emph{erinyes}. She is only
interested in striking deals with powerful mortals, and will thus tempt kings,
lords, arch mages and rich business owners. She is also responsible for
defending hell from invaders, along with Belial. Lilith has a female succubus
called \emph{Eris} as a familiar, and closest ally. Lilith rarely speaks to
anyone directly, instead sending her succubi and incubi to make deals. Due
to her rule over the surface of hell, she is also partially responsible for
defending the layers of hell from outside attacks.

\subsubsection{Asmoday}
\label{sec:Asmoday}

\emph{Asmoday} is the hellish treasurer, and responsible for retrieving,
cataloguing and studying arcane artefacts for their power. He does not deal
with mortals, and prefers to outsource the retrieval of artefacts to other
generals instead. It is believed that the vault of Asmoday contains untold
treasures and artefacts of immense power. He is an immortal tiefling himself,
being a child of Lilith and an unknown mortal.

Asmoday himself is mostly interested in procuring, studying and creating
artefacts to further the military might of the layers of hell. He prides
himself in making fair deals, and is very well know to be true to his word.
His apprentice is another powerful tiefling called \nameref{sec:Forneus}, who
uses the knowledge that he gained from Asmoday to strike deals with mortals.

\subsubsection{Belial}
\label{sec:Belial}

\emph{Belial} is the main commander of the armies of hell. As a horned devil,
he commands all the lesser forces of hell, such as the armies of bearded,
chain and bone devils, as well as several legions of orthons. He is
responsible for the defence of hell, as well as fighting the layers many
enemies, such as the \nameref{sec:Aurelis} and the \emph{sec:Demons}.

\subsubsection{Runemaster}

The \nameref{sec:Runemaster} is a \emph{remmanon} that gives out power in the
form of arcane runes in exchange for worship. He does not command any legions
of hell, but has a high standing due to his skill in making deals with mortals.
His deals are further detailed in another section of this book.

\subsubsection{Beleth}
\label{sec:Beleth}

\nameref{sec:monster:Beleth} is a succubus that prefers to use a female
humanoid form. She is responsible for striking deals with mortals, and is
known for being cunning, intelligent, ruthless but also fair and honest. She
strikes deals with mortals for powerful artefacts and knowledge, and offers
the services of hell in exchange. She, and her legions of succubi and incubi
negotiators also offer services as neutral arbitrators, councillors and
lawyers. She is the weakest of all generals. Beleth enjoys providing legal
council to evil mortals that have been caught by the authorities. She exploits
their precarious situation to strike deals, but she also enjoys defeating
the forces of good in legal proceedings. Beleth rarely fights physically,
preferring to use guile, cunning, and a silver tongue to win battles.

\begin{35e}{Devils}
  Devil society is \emph{lawful evil} as a whole, but devils may be of any
  evil or neutral alignment. Succubus and incubi (as listed under demons),
  also exist among devils, as all devils are mere descendants of demons.
\end{35e}
