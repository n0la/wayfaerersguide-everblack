\subsection{Devils}
\label{sec:Devils}

Devils, or ``pacru'i'' (draconic for ``devil'' or ``evil spirit''), are a
race of monstrous creatures that descent from the original
\hyperref[sec:Demons]{demons} that attacked \nameref{sec:Aurelis}. The Aurelis
freed some of the demons from their psionic overlord the \nameref{sec:Scourge}
of the Abyss, giving them their own will and freedom.

After refusing to aid the Aurelis in their war, the devils have since
retreated to their own planet called \nameref{sec:Hell}. There they began to
establish their own society. Within devil society the most powerful and strong
rule, and the weaker devils are mercilessly oppressed through violence and
fear. Devils live in a strict hierarchy of power and must obey their superiors
without question, or fear being destroyed. The tyrannical nature of devil
society is often presented as a negative example on how to structure a
society, as it rewards the ruthlessness, evil, and sociopathic tendencies,
while suppressing and stifling skill and talent.

Because of the process that freed them from the enslavement of the scourge,
they have lost all their psionic powers, and now rely on arcane magic for
their technology and sciences. Since they are the youngest of the extra
planetary races, they often offer their services through deals to other races
in exchange for magical artefacts or knowledge. Devils are known to be
devious, intelligent, but often quite blunt and honest in their dealings.

Nevertheless the devils have had ample time to tinker with their own
physiology. While some devils still remain similar to their original demon
form (such as succubi), while some have been changed drastically. The scourge
seed carriers have been exterminated, and new devils have been breed or
engineered to complement the legions of hell, such as the
\hyperref[sec:Tieflings]{tieflings}. They also bolster their ranks with
corrupted creatures of other realms, for example \emph{erinyes} which are
corrupted, broken or brainwashed \nameref{sec:Aurelis}. The devils further
changed themselves physiologically to be resistant to heat and direct contact
to fire. In their society fire holds an important cultural and ideological
significance, as the scourge of the Abyss - their dreaded enemy - is mortally
afraid of it.

\subsubsection{Baphomet}
\label{sec:Baphomet}

The layers of hell are ruled by the emperor \emph{Baphomet}, a large pit
fiend. He rules hell, and all its subjects with supreme power of a tyrant, but
is also responsible for laying down and enforcing the ``tenants of hell'',
a small set of rules, laws and guidelines all of denizens must follow. He
is aided by his generals, that oversee parts of the layers of hell on his
behest. He rarely communicates with mortals, instead sending his generals and
minions to do his bidding. He also rarely leaves hell itself, preferring to
rule from afar through his direct minions or generals. Baphomet further
rewards competent, and capable devils with leadership positions, or additional
powers by issuing out magical artefacts.

\subsubsection{Lilith}

\nameref{sec:Lilith}, often called the \emph{scarlet whore}, rules over the
\nameref{sec:Hells Surface}. She rules over several legions of devils, and
fallen \hyperref[sec:Aurelis]{aurelis} that are called \emph{erinyes}. She is
only interested in striking deals with powerful mortals, and will thus tempt
kings, lords, arch mages and rich business owners. Lilith has converted parts
of the surface into a den of luxury, and debauchery for that very purpose.
Lilith has a female succubus called \emph{Eris} as a familiar, and closest
ally. Lilith rarely speaks to anyone directly, instead sending her succubi and
incubi to make deals. Due to her rule over the surface of hell, she is also
partially responsible for defending the layers of hell from outside
attacks. Along with Belial she is one of the most powerful generals that rule
the layers of hell.

\subsubsection{Asmoday}
\label{sec:Asmoday}

\emph{Asmoday} is the hellish treasurer, and rules over a layer of hell aptly
named the \nameref{sec:Treasury}. He is responsible for retrieving,
cataloguing and studying arcane artefacts for their power. He does not deal
with mortals, and prefers to outsource the retrieval of artefacts to other
generals instead. It is believed that the vault of Asmoday contains untold
treasures and artefacts of immense power. He is an immortal tiefling himself,
and the first born of Lilith. Asmoday himself is mostly interested in
procuring, studying and creating artefacts to further the military might of
the layers of hell. Rumours persist that Asmoday has been tasked by Baphomet
himself to procure arcane technology that shields the layers of hell from
extra-planar teleportation, and thus from demonic invasion. Asmoday has two
apprentices: Forneus and Ishtar. Asmoday is also responsible for inventing the
\hyperref[sec:Implants]{arcane and divine implants} that devils use to modify
their bodies and abilities.

\subsubsection{Forneus}

His first apprentice is another powerful tiefling called
\nameref{sec:Forneus}, who uses the knowledge that he gained from Asmoday to
strike deals with mortals. He prides himself in making fair deals, and is very
well know to be true to his word. Forneus is also the patron of arcane
research among mortals, as well as devils and oversees various research
projects and the spread of arcane literacy among devils.

\subsubsection{Ishtar}

The other is a female wingless succubus called \nameref{sec:Ishtar} (or
\emph{Inanna}). She is mainly responsible for using the knowledge gained by
Asmoday to free other demons from the scourge's influence. She is also
responsible for returning magical powers that were lost when the telepathic
link to the scourge was broken by surgically implanting devils with arcane
artefacts.  Ishtar further performs plastic surgery to repair bodily defects
of freed demons, as the scourge cared little about proper bodily proportion or
a sense of beauty. She is also an apt healer, surgeon and promotes and
furthers medical research.

\subsubsection{Belial}
\label{sec:Belial}

\emph{Belial} is the main commander of the armies of hell, and ruler of the
\nameref{sec:Forest}. As a horned devil and the left hand of Baphomet, he
outranks and commands all the lesser forces of hell, such as the armies of
bearded, chain and bone devils, as well as several legions of orthons. He is
responsible for the defence of hell, as well as fighting the layers many
enemies, such as the \nameref{sec:Aurelis} and the \nameref{sec:Demons}.

\subsubsection{Runemaster}

The \nameref{sec:Runemaster} is a \emph{remmanon} (a large, horned, humanoid
devil) that gives out power in the form of soul magic runes in exchange for
worship. He does not command any legions of hell, but has a high standing due
to his skill in making deals with mortals. His deals are further detailed in
another section of this book.

\subsubsection{Beleth}
\label{sec:Beleth}

\nameref{sec:monster:Beleth} is a succubus that prefers to use a female
humanoid form. She is responsible for striking deals with mortals, and is
known for being cunning, intelligent, ruthless but also fair and honest. She
strikes deals with mortals for powerful artefacts and knowledge, and offers
the services of hell in exchange. She, and her legions of succubi and incubi
negotiators also offer services as neutral arbitrators, councillors and
lawyers. As Baphomets personal aide, right hand woman, and spokesperson she is
considered the most powerful among all generals. Beleth enjoys providing legal
council to evil mortals that have been caught by the authorities. She exploits
their precarious situation to strike deals, but she also enjoys defeating the
forces of justice in legal proceedings. Beleth rarely fights physically,
preferring to use guile, cunning, and a silver tongue to win battles.

\begin{35e}{Devils}
  Devil society is \emph{lawful evil} as a whole, but devils may be of any
  alignment. Succubus and incubi, also exist among devils, as all devils are
  mere descendants of demons.
\end{35e}
