\subsection{Dwarves}
\label{sec:Dwarves}

\emph{Dwarves} are a race of short humanoid species, belonging to four core
races that left \nameref{sec:Arania} several millennia ago. By nature dwarven
are smaller than the other races. Their stout physique lends them to tasks that
require prolonged endurance, and are thus natural labourers, and warriors.
Much like their closely related core humanoid cousins, most dwarves enjoy
living with the other core humanoid races in large kingdoms, cities, and
towns.

The dwarves that still remain in the depths are often not as open, welcoming
and tolerant. These dwarven tribes have survived the harsh realities of the
deep by creating a strictly ordered society based on castes. The clans of the
deep might be slow to trust foreigners, reclusive, isolationists, or outright
xenophobic. This culture a foundation of the the kingdom of
\nameref{sec:Kesmar}, which was founded by an isolationist, and xenophobic
tribe of dwarves millennia ago. Such dwarven cultures are only a fraction of
the living dwarven population however, and the vast majority of them live
happily together with their brethren.

\begin{35e}{Dwarf Traits}
  \emph{Rutari} is the language that dwarves of the deep speak, and is also
  the language of \nameref{sec:Kesmar}. It has its own alphabet, which is
  also called Rutari.

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or
      penalties due to their size.
    \item Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this
      speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or
      heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such
      situations).
    \item Dwarves are sturdy and hardy, and thus have a +2 racial bonus to
      constitution.
    \item Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist
      being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when
      climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the
      ground).
    \item Languages: Rutari, Teranim. Bonus Languages: Any (except secret
      languages)
    \item Favoured Class: Any. When determining whether a multi class takes an
          experience point penalty, his or her highest-level class does not
          count.
  \end{itemize}
