\subsection{Monstrous Races}
\label{sec:Monstrous Races}

\subsubsection{Cultures}

Among the other great and advanced monstrous races belong \textbf{hobgoblins},
\textbf{ogres}, \textbf{bugbears}, \textbf{trolls}, \textbf{gnolls},
\textbf{goblins}, \textbf{kobolds}, \textbf{lizard folk}, \textbf{harpies}
and \textbf{medusa}.

Although the ogres are superior in terms of bodily strength and size, they
often live in smaller clans. Ogres often follow an aspect of
\nameref{sec:Marwaid}, and remain hunters and gatherers. Although primitive
in ways, ogres are among the most peaceful of the monstrous races and abhor
slavery. Ogres are, like most monstrous races, suspicious of humanoids and
other monstrous races, but prefer to talk, trade and live peacefully with
others.

Bugbears also build smaller clans or perhaps towns, and prefer to hide, hunt
and steal from other races over enganging in direct conflict. Many other
monstrous races, and sometimes even humanoids, hire bugbears as mercenaries,
spies, soldiers or guards. Bugbears have a reputation for being honourable,
and true to their word.

Harpies often live high up in mountains, such as the \nameref{sec:Great Divide}
or the \nameref{sec:Cnamh Mountains}, where they are known to pray on anyone
foolish enough to wander into their territory. Harpies live a primitive hunter
and gather live, but are renowned for their excellent marksmanship and hunting
prowess, but prefer not to come into contact with other species.

\begin{35e}{Monstrous Races}
  Most monstrous races do not have a fixed alignment, although certain
  cultures tend towards certain alignments. For example most bugbear clans
  tend to be lawful neutral, while their counterparts the hobgoblins are most
  likely to be lawful evil. Ogres are often even good or neutral, compared to
  gnoll who often are neutral, or even chaotic evil.

  Those races not described here follow the lore of the SRD.
