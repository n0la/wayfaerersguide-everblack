\subsection{Tieflings}
\label{sec:Tieflings}

The tieflings are a humanoid-like species engineered by the
\hyperref[sec:Devils]{devils} that inhabit the layers of hell. Most tieflings
are considered devils, but are listed here as they were specifically designed
by the devils as workers, soldiers, and servants. They inhabit all layers of
hell, and some fled to Aror to escape a life of servitude, forced labour and
death in the wars they were supposed to fight.

There is a common misconception that tieflings are the children of succubi or
erinyes, and a humanoid creature, but that is very, very rarely the case. Most
tieflings are bred by the fiendish breed masters, and are engineered through
arcane and scientific machinations. Creatures born of the spawns of the Abyss,
and humanoids are rarely born in the first place, having their unique
physiology absorbed by the Abyss before they can mature.

Many tieflings share a largely humanoid physique, and often have a wide mix of
other more hellish features, such as tails, wings, horns, oversized and
protruding teeth, a wide palette of skin colours (ranging from red, to blue
and even light hues of green), or perhaps sharp, distinct eyes that resemble
reptiles.

Tieflings usually inhabit the layers of hell, but a large population of them
also hides among the humanoids in the large city kingdoms. There they lived
in hiding, but in relative peace. In the aftermath of the \hyperref[sec:Devil
  Siege]{devil siege of Forsby} many tieflings were either exiled, driven
away, or even outright sentenced and convicted for being supposed spies and
agents of the devils. Most tieflings either returned to the layers of hell, or
fled to rural areas to hide and live in secret. Such a life in hiding is
necessary, as the church of \nameref{sec:Lor} actively hunts and prosecutes
tieflings for being evil, and hellish abominations that are in league with
devils, whether or not that is actually true of the individual.

  The basic 3.5e traits of tieflings are still in place, except that their
  favoured class has been changed to \emph{any}, instead of \emph{rogue}.
