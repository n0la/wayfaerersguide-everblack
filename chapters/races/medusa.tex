\subsection{Medusa}
\label{sec:Medusa}

Medusa are an all-female, half-humanoid half-reptilian race that lives
mostly in hot and wet climates. They can be found in the rain forests of
\nameref{sec:Yuacata}, the \nameref{sec:Silver Isles} and \nameref{sec:Goban}.

Legend has it, that a group of female humanoid wizards, that sought great
power, betrayed \nameref{sec:Forneus} in a deal, who in turn cursed them as
punishment. He turned their hair to snakes, diminished their humanoid beauty
with reptilian traits, and made their gaze lethal to anyone they look upon.
Most medusa despise Forneus however, seeing his deals a way to cheat oneself
to arcane power that has not been earned through study and cunning.

Whether or not this is true, medusa are known to be excellent wizards,
sorceress and arcane scholars. Medusa build large towers, castles and
underground complexes that act as their arcane laboratories, libraries and
studies. There they research the arcane, build magical golems, and craft
artefacts. Lone medusa also join monstrous tribes as wizards, arcane smiths,
witches and spiritual leaders.

Since there are no male medusa, they use their skills and arcane weaponry
to raid other monstrous and humanoid settlements to capture and enslave
males. These slaves are then used for reproduction, menial labour as well as
guards and soldiers.

Sometimes the union of a medusa and a male humanoid (such as an elf, human or
dwarf) results in a half-medusa race called \hyperref[sec:Gorgons]{gorgons}.
These gorgons are then usually cast out from Medusa society, as the medusa
view them as impure and lesser.

\begin{35e}{Medusa}
  Most Medusa can be found in small groups, living in elaborate and well
  stocked and equipped arcane laboratories. They may have any alignment, but
  avoid the extremes, such as \emph{chaotic evil} or \emph{lawful good}.
