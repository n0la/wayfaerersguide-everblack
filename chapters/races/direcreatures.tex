\subsubsection{Dire Creatures}
\label{sec:Dire Creatures}

Dire creatures are animals (or other non-intelligent) creatures possessed by a
daemon of the \nameref{sec:Soul Well}. They do not occur naturally, and are
always the creation of a \hyperref[sec:Druids]{druid}. Dire animals, and
creatures, are taller, bigger, stronger, and faster than their base creature,
and since they are being possessed by a daemon, they are always
intelligent. The druids fused the daemons soul into the soul of the animal or
creature, often causing both immense pain and suffering. Thus most dire
creatures, and the daemons they host, are often angry, aggressive, if not
outright evil, and twisted.

\begin{35e}{Dire Creatures}
  Dire creatures (dire wolf, dire bears etc.), are all either chaotic neutral,
  or worse (i.e. evil). They do not follow druids willingly, and are generally
  a menace upon the land. Slaying a dire creature kills the living host, but
  the daemon vanishes back into the \nameref{sec:Soul Well}.
\end{35e}
