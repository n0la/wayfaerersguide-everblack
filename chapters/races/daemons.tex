\subsection{Daemons}
\label{sec:Daemons}

Daemons are extra-ordinarly long lived and powerful souls that still roam
Aror to this day. Unlike undead spirits, daemons live within the vast sea
of soul power that connects most souls together, and are thus everywhere and
nowhere at once. They can manifest as spiritual ghost, or can even create
and inhabit physical bodies.

Daemons are not a species per se, but rather a group of individual souls that
have all evolved into a similar form: that of a soul spirit. Daemons are
rarely favourable in their dealings with mortals. Most have a warped sense of
reality and morality, and will often treat mortal life with disregard,
contempt or even outright hostility. They are incredibly powerful, and have
no concept of time as they are generally immortal.

This behaviour has earned them the nickname ``daemon'', which is a generic
categorisation used in many languages for an evil spirit. Their evil often
does not spring from malevolence, but rather from distorted, idiosyncratic
behaviour and worldviews. Some daemons however are evil, but can be reasoned
with at least within the confines of their twisted reason.

The most well known daemon is \nameref{sec:Morana} who shepherds souls within
the soul well.
