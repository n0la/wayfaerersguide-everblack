\subsection{Half-Elves}
\label{sec:Half-Elves}

Very, very rarely the union of an \hyperref[sec:Elves]{elf} and a
\hyperref[sec:Humans]{human} produces not the species of the mother, but a
half breed. These half breeds are then simply called \emph{half-elves}. They
inherit their slender appearance from their elven heritage, often looking
beautiful, gracious and fair. However they only live up to eighty years,
much like their human parents. They are well accepted by most cities and towns
of the humanoid races, and often use their elven appearance to take up jobs as
entertainers, diplomats, traders and bankers. They are known to be hard working,
conscientious, intelligent and crafty.

Since very few half elves are ever born at any given time, a small but highly
dedicated community of half elves have arisen in most larger centres of
civilisation. These communities often aid and support any born half elf, even
though they rarely face any difficulties to begin with. Since the half elves
are born so rarely, and their trait is non-dominant (meaning that only the
union of two half elves produces another half elf), these communities openly
encourage marriage among their members to grow the community and the species
as a whole.

\begin{35e}{Half-Elf traits}
  The following items are in addition to the base 3.5e half-elf traits, as
  described in the d20 SRD.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Having gained the natural beauty and fairness of the elven heritage,
    they gain a +2 racial bonus to Charisma.
  \item They have inherited the craftiness of their human parents and thus
    gain 4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each
    additional level.
  \end{itemize}
