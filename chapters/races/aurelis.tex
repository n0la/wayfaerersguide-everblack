\subsection{Aurelis}
\label{sec:Aurelis}

The Aurelis are an extra planar species of winged humanoids, native to the plane
of Celestis.

They often have pale, light blue or light red skin, long white or blond hair,
and feathered wings. Their wings often match their hair colour, and allow them
to both fly and glide through the air. Aurelis are immortal, and can thus become
extraordinarily powerful as they have all eternity to train, learn and hone
their skills. Aurelis speak their own language called \emph{ralis}, with
their own alphabet.

Aurelis are builders of great civilisations, cities and are expert arcane and
divine craftsmen. They are responsible for creating many powerful arcane and
divine artefacts that mad their way to Aror. Their societies are centred
around the concepts of liberty, freedom as well as aiding and helping
others. Aurelis are still lead by one high king or queen, who rules mostly
symbolically while an elected council runs the society.

The current patriarch of Aurelis is called \nameref{sec:Lor}. Their current
and all past patriarchs and matriarchs are also worshipped as gods in ancestor
worship. Together they are powerful enough to grand the clerics and priests
of Aurelis with divine power.

\subsubsection{Celestis}
\label{sec:Celestis}

They originally hailed from the plane of Celestis, a beautiful Aror-like planet
with lush forests, tall mountains and vast seas. But their home
was invaded by the \hyperref[sec:Scourge]{scourge} of the \nameref{sec:Abyss}
several aeons ago. The resulting war lasted for centuries, and although the
Aurelis were victorious against the scourge their planet was destroyed and
polluted. It is now a global desolate wasteland, that is being rebuilt by the
surviving Aurelis population.

\subsubsection{Devils}

During the war against the scourge of the Abyss the Aurelis attempted to break
the demons psionic bond with their creator entity. They succeeded, and gave
those demons freedom with the hope that they'd turn against the scourge that
enslaved them. Instead they retreated from Aurelis to create their own
societies, and are now known as the \hyperref[sec:devils]{Devils}.

\begin{35e}{Aurelis}
  The Aurelis combine the angels and archons of D&D into one group. All in all
  their society can be considered \emph{neutral good}, but the Aurelis may have
  any good alignment.
