\subsection{Aurelis}
\label{sec:Aurelis}

The Aurelis are an extra planetary species of winged humanoids, native to the
planet of \nameref{sec:Celestis}.

Aurelis often have pale white, light blue or light red skin, long white or blond
hair, and large feathered wings. Their wings often match their hair colour,
and allow them to both fly and glide through the air. Aurelis are technically
immortal (but not invulnerable), and can thus become extraordinarily powerful
as they potentially have all eternity to train, learn and hone their
skills. Aurelis speak their own language called \emph{ralis}, with their own
alphabet.

Their ability to fly also makes them lighter in build than most other humanoid
races. Aurelis have hollow bones, a smaller stature (most do not reach 1.70
cm), and are generally weaker than other humanoids of the same stature. Their
frail nature has driven them to become expert armour smiths, capable of
producing superior armour that is still light enough to allow them to
fly. Warriors of the Aurelis often forgo light armour, in favour of heavy
armour to protect them against attacks, but are then reduced to gliding.
The common folk of Aurelis are between 1.60 and 1.70 in height, while the
older, and more powerful of their kind - known as Paragons - are capable of
growing to tremendous heights (up to three metres). With their overly large
wingspans to support their width, these large Aurelis make a awe inspiring
sight to behold.

Aurelis culture heavily favours the individual, individual rights as well as
a peaceful co-existence among each other. There is a focus for allowing all
avenues of expression, and are thus supporters of both the arts and sciences
in equal measures. Aurelis culture also heavily relies on ancestors worship,
as they meticulously catalogue the achievements of those that lived before,
and use their lives as an example to inspire the young.

The average Aurelis are jovial, helpful and loving in nature, but as with most
races, outliers and exceptions exist. This does not mean that they are
incapable of battle and war. Their elite warriors - called paragons - have
their own rituals, long standing history and traditions in the art of battle,
and will confront and destroy anyone and anything that would threaten
\nameref{sec:Celestis}.

Most Aurelis, after the devastating \nameref{sec:War in Heaven}, now live in
their capital city ``Gamos'', a pearl of architectural design and beauty. They
value trade, exchange of sciences and ideas, and always welcome peaceful
travellers to their realm.

Aurelis are builders of great civilisations, and are expert arcane and divine
craftsmen. They are responsible for creating many powerful arcane and divine
artefacts, some of which have made their way to Aror. Their societies are
centred around the concepts of liberty, peace, individuality, freedom as well
as aiding and helping others. Aurelis are still lead by one high king or
queen, who rules mostly symbolically while a democratically elected council
runs the society.

The current patriarch of Aurelis is called \nameref{sec:Lor}. Their current
and all past patriarchs and matriarchs are also worshipped as gods in ancestor
worship, and serve as cultural icons and role models. Together they are
powerful enough to grand the clerics and priests of Aurelis with divine power.

\begin{35e}{Aurelis}
  The Aurelis combine the angels and archons of D\&D into one group. All in all
  their society can be considered \emph{neutral good}, but the Aurelis may have
  any alignment.
