\section{Citizenship}
\label{sec:Citizenship}

The large and vast city kingdoms of the humanoid races take great emphasis
on written documents and record keeping. They also keep a citizen register
within which it all official residents and citizens of the city kingdom are
registered by name, gender, race and age.

Citizens of city kingdoms enjoy additional freedoms within their home nation,
such as the ability to purchase property, found businesses, or own and sell
slaves. Being a citizen of a city nation also offers protection when visiting
other large nations, as many of these cities have mutual protection and
recognition agreements amongst each other that guarantee special wards, such
as protection from enslavement or right to counsel and representation from your
own nation should they be accused of committing crimes.

City nations and kingdoms often issue three types of official identification
papers: \emph{citizen papers}, \hyperref[sec:Citizen Mark]{citizen marks} and
\hyperref[sec:Nobility Mark]{marks of nobility}.

\subsection{Citizen Papers}
\label{sec:Citizen Papers}

The cheapest of all identification methods are the citizen papers. Often a
single scroll, elaborately designed and embellished that holds the citizen's
name, race, gender and age; along with a seal of the kingdom or nation to
which they are a citizen off. These papers are important travel documents for
most citizens, and usually cost between five or ten \hyperref[sec:Shin]{shins}
to be issued. Families often just have one citizen paper for the entire family.
