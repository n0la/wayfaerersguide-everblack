\section{Races}

The people of Aror make up a multi flavoured stew of various races and
backgrounds. Apart from many races that you might be already familiar with,
such as humans, elves, dwarves or gnomes; Aror is also home to some you might
have never heard of before. Two of these are the \emph{deepkin}, the
\emph{diarim} and the \emph{umgeher}.

You will find that race matters little. An elf of \nameref{sec:Norbury} often
shares the warrior culture, and faith in the meritocratic societal ideas
of \emph{Norbury} much like any human. While a dwarf of \emph{Nen-Hilith} will
be accustomed and to the artistic culture and creative ways of the artisans
and performers of that city.

The union of non-humanoid races with humanoid races is something that does
not exist in \emph{Everblack}. Although you might have met ``dragonborn''
(the unity of a human and a dragon) in other realms, you will not find them
on Everblack. And if you do, they are probably extra-planar visitors much
like yourself.

These sections enhance or change the existing core races of D\&D. Any lore you
find in the base books that does not interfere with what is written here, still
holds true.

\subsection{Early History}

Roughly sixty thousand years ago an ice age covered most of the world
of \emph{Aror} in vast sheets of ice and snow. Continents that were separated
by sea, where now suddenly accessible through thick sheets of ice. This
allowed the \textbf{four core humanoid races}, the
\hyperref[sec:Humans]{humans}, \hyperref[sec:Elves]{elves},
\hyperref[sec:Dwarves]{dwarves} and \hyperref[sec:Halflings]{halflings}
to migrate away from \nameref{sec:Arania} and settle the entire known
world. Although the humanoid races were successful in adapting to the new
lands and challenges, they had to face fierce opposition.

\subsubsection{Aeon of Strife}
\label{sec:Aeon of Strife}

When the humanoid races arrived in the other continents they found that they
were already inhabited by sentient races. \textbf{Monstrous races} such as
ogres, minotaurs, trolls, hobgoblins, gnolls, bugbears already called these
continents their home, alongside non-sentient monstrous species such as
hydras, manticores and wyverns. Through ancient stories of the dwarves, early
writings, ancient stone tablets and even cave paintings, it was revealed that
the humanoid ancestors were in a constant state of conflict with these
monstrous races. Wars, skirmishes, and often the destruction of entire early
villages and even cities was a common occurrence in early history. This early
time of constant fighting, turmoil and wars against the sentient beast races
is referred to as the \emph{aeon of strife}.

The aeon saw the birth of many new races, such as
\hyperref[sec:Vampires]{vampires}, \hyperref[sec:Fey]{fey} and
\hyperref[sec:Lycanthropes]{lycanthropes}. It also saw a vast destruction of
nature, as both sides of the war cut down forests, dried swamps, and forever
corrupted landscapes and areas with dark and foul magic.

Even though the aeon of strife is now thousands years past, it is still
vividly remembered in both humanoid and monstrous cultures through stories,
song, and tradition.

\subsubsection{Schism}
\label{sec:Schism}

The ultimately successful survival strategy to deal with such a hostility
during the strife ingrained itself as the cultural core of the humanoid
races. The dwarves went underground and organised themselves in strict
hierarchical clans and cities, that allowed them to optimise their economies to
the harsh realities and lack of resources of the depths. Some humans and elves
followed the dwarves underground but ultimately failed to replicate the
dwarven's success. With a few notable exceptions such as \nameref{sec:Stenheim}.
Although the \nameref{sec:Deepkin}, the underground dwelling cousins of the
humans, built large civilisations underground they were ultimately defeated by
the sentient races of the depths and driven to the surface. The dark elves
instead relied on small clans, families and by being constantly on the move to
ensure the survival of their species.

Meanwhile on the surface elves and halflings sought to settle as far away from
the monstrous races as possible, leading them to the continent of \emph{South
Goltir} and \emph{Farlar}. Other elves settled in the frozen north and south,
becoming known as the \nameref{sec:Snow Elves}. Humans on the other hand used
their ingenuity and skill to build great civilisations and cities that could
potentially withstand the skirmishes and sieges of the sentient monstrous
races. Through many iterations over the course of thousands of years, which
resulted in countless destroyed and ransacked cities and fallen civilisations,
humans have now achieved the unthinkable: dethrone the monstrous races as the
predominant species across all of Aror.

\subsubsection{Exodus from the Depths}
\label{sec:Exodus from the Depths}

Now many elves and halflings have joined the human effort of building large
centres of civilisation, enriching the predominantly human city kingdoms that
dot the world of \emph{Aror}. Their struggle against the sentient monstrous
races is far from over, especially in the central regions of the continents,
or from the still predominantly monstrous continent of \emph{IÃ¢fandir}. The
majority of dwarves have remained underground, continuing their strict ways of
life as it has served them for aeons. A success that was not shared by the
dark elves and deepkin, who have mostly abandoned the deep and returned to the
surface.

\subsubsection{Languages}
\label{sec:Languages}

The races of Aror speak a variety of languages, although \hyperref[sec:Speak
Language]{Teranim} has become lingua franca on Aror. It is not uncommon for
many people to speak several different foreign languages together with their
native and regional dialect.

\begin{note}
  You can find a comprehensive list of languages, alphabets and common speakers
  of that language in the section for the skill ``Speak
  Language'' \hyperref[sec:Speak Language]{later in the document}.

\section{Monstrous Races}
\label{sec:Monstrous Races}

\aren{For a long time I considered an honorable and noble ogre named
  Gor'esch'tar my best friend. Mothers' bless his kind soul.}

When the core humanoid races set forth from the continent
of \nameref{sec:Arania} to settle the world, they found it already inhabited
by many different monstrous races. Some of which are sentient, others even
built civilisations such as towns, cities or even kingdoms, while others are
mere beasts and animals. Monstrous races can be found on all of Aror, but are
rarer on \nameref{sec:Eilean Mor} as they have been pushed back by the
humanoid races on that continent for hundreds of years.

\subsubsection{Two Fronts}

Much like with humanoids, you will find members of the monstrous races from
all walks of life, holding many different believes, exhibiting all kinds of
attitudes, and perhaps even sharing the very same dreams and hopes that you do
as well. The only constant on Aror is the centuries old feud between monstrous
and humanoid races that finds its roots in the \nameref{sec:Aeon of
  Strife}. It has sown hatred, distrust, animosity and cost thousands, if not
millions of lives on both sides.

Even after the aeon of strife had ended, many beast races continued to raid
human settlements, entrenching the divide between the two deeper and deeper.
Hobgoblins, ogres, trolls and bugbears often sail south from the shores of
\nameref{sec:Iafandir} towards \nameref{sec:Eilean Mor}, raiding the coastal
villages and baronies for wealth, food, artefacts and slaves. This in turn
gave rise to warring nations such as \nameref{sec:Norbury} or
\nameref{sec:Morkan}, adding fuel to the hatred between the two factions.

This is often precipitated by the ever expanding humanoid settlements, who
encroach on land already inhabited by monstrous tribes and villages. Since the
city kingdoms, baronies and lordships often wield bigger military might, they
sometimes forcefully remove, exile or even kill monstrous tribes to continue
their expansion.
