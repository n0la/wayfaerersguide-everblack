\chapter{Races}
\label{sec:Races}

\section{Introduction}

The people of Aror make up a multi flavoured stew of various races and
backgrounds. Apart from many races that you might be already familiar with,
such as humans, elves, dwarves or gnomes; Aror is also home to some you might
have never heard of before. Some of these are the
\hyperref[sec:Deepkin]{deepkin}, the \hyperref[sec:Diarim]{diarim},
\hyperref[sec:Gorgons]{gorgons} and the \hyperref[sec:Umgeher]{umgeher}.

You will find that race matters little. An elf of \nameref{sec:Norbury} often
shares the warrior culture, and faith in the meritocratic societal ideas
of Norbury much like any human or halfling living there. While a dwarf of
\nameref{sec:Nen-Hilith} will be accustomed and to the artistic culture and
creative ways of the artisans and performers of that city.

The union of non-humanoid races with humanoid races is something that does not
exist in \emph{Aror}. Although you might have met ``dragonborn'' (the unity of
a human and a dragon) in other realms, you will not find them on Aror. And if
you do, they are probably extra-planar visitors much like yourself.

\begin{note}
  These sections enhance or change the existing core races of D\&D. Any lore
  you find in the base books that does not interfere with what is written
  here, still holds true.

    Core humanoid races of Aror: humans, elves, dwarves and halflings.
\end{figure*}
\fi

The core humanoid races of Aror are those races that originate from the
original dwarves, humans, halflings and elves that left the content of
\nameref{sec:Arania} thousands of years ago. Deepkin and Humans are listed as
separate species, yet they are very close to one another. Even though some
species have shown variants, such as elves and humans, all of these are still
close enough to one another to produce viable offspring in an union.

The core races generally have good relations with one another, and also live
happily together in large city kingdoms, baronies or towns. The only exception
being a few secluded, traditionalist and xenophobic dwarven clans that prefer
to isolate themselves into their mountains. But their open minded,
good-spirited, and city dwelling cousins outnumber them easily a hundred times
over.

The union of any of the core humanoid races with a dwarven mother always leads
to a half-breed offspring. This is unique to dwarven mothers, as in any other
inter-racial mating, the child is always of the same race as the mother. The
child of a dwarven mother and halfling are called gnomes. The child of a
dwarven mother and a human are called muls, and the child of a dwarven mother
and any elf are simply called half-elves. The orcs seem appear to be the only
monstrous species capable of reliably producing living offspring with the
core humanoid races, and the child of an orc and a dwarven mother also makes
a half breed: the half-orc. \nameref{sec:Medusa} must rely on humanoids to
produce, and sometimes this union gives birth to a half-breed called
\emph{Gorgons}.

\section{Engineered Races}
\label{sec:Engineered Races}

Throughout the years many more advanced extra-planar species have attempted to
engineer their own species. The most common being the Diarim, an engineered
slave species that were made by the giants as soldiers and labourers. Umgeher
are an undead species that were made by the \nameref{sec:Vampires} of the
\nameref{sec:Helmarnock}, but are the rarest of all races of Aror.

\section{Monstrous Races}
\label{sec:Monstrous Races}

\aren{For a long time I considered an honorable and noble ogre named Gor'tar
  my best friend. Mothers' bless his kind soul.}

When the core humanoid races set forth from the continent
of \nameref{sec:Arania} to settle the world, they found it already inhabited a
wide variety of sentient, and intelligent races. Many of which had already
built civilisations such as towns, cities or even kingdoms. These races became
known as the ``monstrous races'' among the core humanoid races.

Much like with humanoids, you will find members of the monstrous races from
all walks of life, holding many different believes, exhibiting all kinds of
attitudes, and perhaps even sharing the very same dreams and hopes as you. The
only constant on Aror is the centuries old feud between monstrous and humanoid
races that finds its roots in the \nameref{sec:Strife}. It has sown hatred,
distrust, animosity and cost thousands, if not millions of lives on both
sides.

Even after the aeon of strife had ended, many beast races continued to raid
human settlements, entrenching the divide between the two deeper and deeper.
Hobgoblins, ogres, trolls and bugbears often sail south from the shores of
\nameref{sec:Iafandir} towards \nameref{sec:Eilean Mor}, raiding the coastal
villages and baronies for wealth, food, artefacts and slaves. This in turn
gave rise to warring nations such as \nameref{sec:Norbury} or
\nameref{sec:Morkan}, adding fuel to the hatred between the two factions.

This is often precipitated by the ever expanding humanoid settlements, who
encroach on land already inhabited by monstrous tribes and villages. Since the
city kingdoms, baronies and lordships often wield bigger military might, they
sometimes forcefully remove, exile or even kill monstrous tribes to continue
their expansion.

\section{Soul Aberrations}
\label{sec:Soul Aberrations}

Soul Aberrations is a blanket term for certain creatures that are somehow made
of soul energy, but are neither undead, or naturally living beings. Perchten,
are a prime example of soul aberrations, as they are not supposed to retain
their individuality within the soul well.

\subsection{Elementals}
\label{sec:Elementals}

Elementals are soul aberrations where soul magic has fused with one (or more)
natural elements. As an example, soul power infused fire would be a fire
elemental, soul power infused water would be a water elemental, and so forth.
These elementals are extremely rare in the natural world, and might form were
a massive amount of elemental matter is responsibly for an imbalance in
regional natural soul power. Fire elementals have been known to rise from the
burning of mass graves, or water elementals from where a lot of animals, or
plants have died due to floods. The most common source of elementals however
is the careless conjuration, and manipulation of soul energy by magic
wielders.

Much like animals elementals have no intelligence, but will defend themselves
if attacked. Elementals may also follow the orders of a magic wielder who
has either conjured them, or taken control over them through spells, or
incantations.

\begin{35e}{Elementals}
  Elementals are no longer outsiders, but instead may be conjured out of the
  soul well. Once dead the soul energy returns back to the soul well, and the
  remaining elemental matter remains on Aror.
\end{35e}

\subsection{Daemons}
\label{sec:Daemons}

\begin{displayquote}
  ``18: The waters of the WELL are opaque, shallow and a barrier not easily
  traversed. 19: All beings rise above, few live between, and even fewer breathe
  beneath. 20: Beware of the ones that sleep beneath the black waters. 21: For
  they are beyond the horizons of time and space.`` WELL 18-21
\end{displayquote}

Daemons are extra-ordinarily long lived and powerful souls that still roam Aror
to this day. Unlike undead spirits, daemons live within the \hyperref[sec:Soul
  Well]{vast sea of souls} that connects all souls together, and are thus
everywhere and nowhere at once. They can manifest as spiritual ghost, or can
even create and inhabit physical bodies.

Daemons are not a species per se, but rather they are souls that resisted
dissipated within the \nameref{sec:Soul Well}. Daemons are rarely favourable
in their dealings with mortals. Most have a warped sense of reality and
morality, and will often treat mortal life with disregard, contempt or even
outright hostility. They are incredibly powerful, and have no concept of time,
as they are generally immortal. Daemons may possess living beings, using them
as hosts to enact their sinister plans.

This behaviour has earned them the nickname ``daemon'', which is a generic
categorisation used in many languages for an evil spirit. Their evil often
does not spring from malevolence, but rather from distorted, idiosyncratic
behaviour and world views. Some daemons however are evil, but can be reasoned
with at least within the confines of their twisted morality.

\section{Extra-Planar Species}
\label{sec:ExtraPlanar Species}

The following pages list a few species that have their planet relatively close
to Aror. In the early years (before MI), many believed that these places were
\emph{extra planar dimensions}, but after the advent of astronomy this was
revealed to be an error. Instead these planes are just other planets in
different solar systems. Due to the history of the book, the terms
\emph{planet} and \emph{planes} are used interchangeably at various points.

\begin{35e}{Outsiders}
  Creatures that are typed \emph{outsider} simply come from another planet,
  and are living, breathing creatures (i.e. ``native outsiders''). If they die
  on Aror, they die permanently, and are not sent back to their ``home
  plane''. This also holds true for summoned creatures. The spells that send
  outsiders back to their home planes, simply do that: they forcefully reverse
  the teleportation magic that brought the creatures to Aror. An ``outsider''
  creature born on Aror is no longer considered an ``outsider''.
\end{35e}

\begin{35e}{Planes}
  These planes are also not affiliated with any alignment, and have normal
  limitations that any other planet in a solar system might have.
