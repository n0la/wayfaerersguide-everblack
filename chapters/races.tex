\chapter{Races}
\label{sec:Races}

\section{Introduction}

The people of Aror make up a multi flavoured stew of various races and
backgrounds. Apart from many races that you might be already familiar with,
such as humans, elves, dwarves or gnomes; Aror is also home to some you might
have never heard of before. Two of these are the
\hyperref[sec:Deepkin]{deepkin}, the \hyperref[sec:Diarim]{diarim},
\hyperref[sec:Gorgons]{gorgons} and the \hyperref[sec:Umgeher]{umgeher}.

You will find that race matters little. An elf of \nameref{sec:Norbury} often
shares the warrior culture, and faith in the meritocratic societal ideas
of \emph{Norbury} much like any human. While a dwarf of \emph{Nen-Hilith} will
be accustomed and to the artistic culture and creative ways of the artisans
and performers of that city.

The union of non-humanoid races with humanoid races is something that does
not exist in \emph{Everblack}. Although you might have met ``dragonborn''
(the unity of a human and a dragon) in other realms, you will not find them
on Everblack. And if you do, they are probably extra-planar visitors much
like yourself.

\begin{note}
These sections enhance or change the existing core races of D\&D. Any lore you
find in the base books that does not interfere with what is written here, still
holds true.

\section{Core Races}

    Core humanoid races of Aror: humans, elves, dwarves and halflings.
\end{figure*}

The core humanoid races of Aror are those races that originate from the
original dwarves, humans and elves that left the content of \nameref{sec:Arania}
thousands of years ago. Even though Deepkin and Humans are listed as separate
species, they are very close to one another. Even though more variety exists
by the elves they are still so close to one another that they are capable of
creating viable and healthy offspring among each other.

The core races generally have good relations with one another, and also live
happily together in large city kingdoms. The only exception being secluded,
traditionalist and xenophobe dwarven clans that prefer to seclude themselves
into their mountains. But their open minded, good-spirited, and city dwelling
cousins outnumber them easily a hundred times over.

\section{Half-Races}
\label{sec:Half-Races}

The vast plethora of humanoid races also often leads to hybrids, or half
races. Below you find a list of the most common that can be found on Aror.
Pleas note that many other inter species unions usually produce the species
of the mother, instead of a half race.

\section{Engineered Races}
\label{sec:Engineered Races}

Throughout the years many more advanced extra-planar species have attempted to
engineer their own species. The most common being the Diarim, an engineered
slave species that were made by the giants as soldiers and labourers. Umgeher
are an undead species that were made by the \nameref{sec:Vampires} of the
\nameref{sec:Helmarnock}, but are the rarest of all races of Aror.

\section{Monstrous Races}
\label{sec:Monstrous Races}

\aren{For a long time I considered an honorable and noble ogre named Gor'tar
  my best friend. Mothers' bless his kind soul.}

When the core humanoid races set forth from the continent
of \nameref{sec:Arania} to settle the world, they found it already inhabited
by many different monstrous races. Some of which are sentient, others even
built civilisations such as towns, cities or even kingdoms, while others are
mere beasts and animals. Monstrous races can be found on all of Aror, but are
rarer on \nameref{sec:Eilean Mor} as they have been pushed back by the
humanoid races on that continent for hundreds of years.

\subsubsection{Two Fronts}

Much like with humanoids, you will find members of the monstrous races from
all walks of life, holding many different believes, exhibiting all kinds of
attitudes, and perhaps even sharing the very same dreams and hopes that you do
as well. The only constant on Aror is the centuries old feud between monstrous
and humanoid races that finds its roots in the \nameref{sec:Aeon of
  Strife}. It has sown hatred, distrust, animosity and cost thousands, if not
millions of lives on both sides.

Even after the aeon of strife had ended, many beast races continued to raid
human settlements, entrenching the divide between the two deeper and deeper.
Hobgoblins, ogres, trolls and bugbears often sail south from the shores of
\nameref{sec:Iafandir} towards \nameref{sec:Eilean Mor}, raiding the coastal
villages and baronies for wealth, food, artefacts and slaves. This in turn
gave rise to warring nations such as \nameref{sec:Norbury} or
\nameref{sec:Morkan}, adding fuel to the hatred between the two factions.

This is often precipitated by the ever expanding humanoid settlements, who
encroach on land already inhabited by monstrous tribes and villages. Since the
city kingdoms, baronies and lordships often wield bigger military might, they
sometimes forcefully remove, exile or even kill monstrous tribes to continue
their expansion.

\section{Extra-Planar Species}
\label{sec:ExtraPlanar Species}

The following pages list a few species that have their plane relatively close
to Aror. In the early years (before MI), many believed that these places were
\emph{extra planar dimensions}, but after the advent of astronomy this was
revealed to be an error. Instead these planes are just other planets in
different solar systems. Due to the history of the book, the terms
\emph{planet} and \emph{planes} are used interchangeably at various points.

\begin{35e}{Outsiders}
  Creatures that are typed \emph{outsider} simply come from another planet. If
  they die on Aror, they die permanently, and are not sent back to their
  ``home plane''. This also holds true for summoned creatures. The spells that
  send outsiders back to their home planes, simply do that: they forcefully
  reverse the teleportation magic that brought the creatures to Aror. An
  ``outsider'' creature born on Aror is no longer considered an ``outsider''.
\end{35e}

\begin{35e}{Planes}
  These planes are also not affiliated with any alignment, and have normal
  limitations that any other planet in a solar system does.
\end{35e}
