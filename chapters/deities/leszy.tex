\subsection{Leszy}
\label{sec:Leszy}

Leszy (or ``leshiy'' or ``leshy'') is a \hyperref[sec:Daemons]{daemon} and
deity that inhabits the vast forest in the \nameref{sec:Toralian Highlands}. He
often appears as a monstrous, gigantic humanoid male with green skin and plant
growths covering his body. He may change his appearance, height and physique,
as any daemon can, and will show himself often to travellers that get lost in
the vast forest east of \nameref{sec:Forsby}

It is unclear whether he is good or evil, as some reports portray him as a
helpful spirit guiding people out of the forest, while others have reported
that he sometimes abducts children from villages. Regardless of his alignment,
he loathes tempering with forests and will attack anyone that seeks to damage
the forest on a massive scale.

Leszy's origins are unclear. While the corrupted druids claim that Leszy
poisoned their minds and souls, the old ways tell stories about how Leszy is
simply a manifestation of the combined corrupted will of the druids. Regardless
of his origin, many druids still follow him and see him as their deity.
