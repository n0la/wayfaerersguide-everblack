\emph{Morana} (also Marena, Marzanna, Morena, Mara, ``lady death'', the
``great betrayer''), is the lesser deity of death, winter, cold and the undead.
In the old manuscripts she is often depicted as a black veiled female humanoid
with pale skin. In newer works of art and literature, made after the her
deceit was discovered, she is often shown as a blue, translucent female
humanoid ghost, stealing or shepherding souls.

\subsubsection{Great Betrayer}
\label{sec:Great Betrayer}

Originally she was believed to be a greater deity of death, cold and winter,
and thus was often seen as the fourth sister to \nameref{sec:Forun},
\nameref{sec:Marwaid} and \nameref{sec:Nyddwr}. She was seen as the last stage
of motherhood: the old woman that died, but still holds her protective hand
over her children from the afterlife. Welcoming, and beckoning her children to
her side once their time had come. She was thus a major part of the
\nameref{sec:Old Ways} once, before she was almost unilaterally rejected, and
now holds the role of a villain in the religion.

During the \nameref{sec:Strife} some of her followers prayed to her to
give them strength against the monsters and monstrous races that threatened
the humanoid races. As an answer she revealed to the early humanoids the
knowledge on how to create \nameref{sec:Vampires}. She did so secretly and
indirectly, as to not arouse suspicion that she was not in fact a greater
deity.

Her followers were promised great power, strength and eternal life, but Morana
did not reveal the many drawbacks and sacrifices that came with the undead
life. Many of her followers accepted her gift. Upon realising that their new
form was savage, evil and animalistic in nature, and a danger to the very
humanoids they sought to protect, the majority of her followers turned away
from her. This angered Morana greatly, and in retaliation she openly
threatened the vampires and high priests with death should they abandon her
faith.

Since higher deities do not speak to their followers, as they are abstract
concepts and not extra planar entities that live and breathe, her deception
was brought to the light. This deception and betrayal angered almost all of
her followers who in turn abandoned her. Morana however saw the threat through,
and killed most of her undead followers, and arch priests.

This betrayal was never forgotten and she's now simply known as the
\emph{great betrayer}, among most of the humanoid species. Her name is never
spoken directly, as it is considered too much honour for a being so petty,
deceitful and evil. Her remaining followers call her either \emph{lady Death}
or \emph{Morana}.

Most baronies and city kingdoms ban her worship. The duties of burying the
dead have been taken over by the church of \nameref{sec:Forun} or the church
of \nameref{sec:Lor}. Although she has followers among the \nameref{sec:Inua},
as well as less civilised undead, such as feral vampires or liches, her worship
is rejected among the civilised undead such as \nameref{sec:Vampires} and
\nameref{sec:Umgeher}. Her most devout followers are the witches of
\nameref{sec:Walburga}, who have done much to keep her place within the
traditions of the Old Ways alive. Much of her redemption in the eyes of the
common people come from the witches' stead-fast devotion to the Old Ways, and
their favourable, good-spirited interpretation of Morana's teachings.

Morana's modern teachings openly encourages the creation and spreading of
intelligent undead, and she helps powerful necromancers to achieve
lichdom. She also welcomes anyone who wishes to practise necromancy, and sees
all undead as her children, even if they reject her. She still respects the
wishes of the deceased, and allows for a wide range of burial rituals, even if
they'd hinder the creation of undead.

She now holds poor relations with most other deities and their followers,
especially the true deities that are still worshipped in the \nameref{sec:Old
  Ways}. Her direct enemy is \nameref{sec:Lor}, who openly opposes her
followers for creating and summoning undead. Morana and \nameref{sec:Isamir}
appear to be on good terms, as they are both worshipped together among the
\nameref{sec:Inua} of the \nameref{sec:Kanaria Archipelago}.

\begin{35e}{Morana}
  She is considered \emph{neutral evil}, and her favoured weapon is the
  morning star. Her domains are evil, death, destruction and knowledge.
