\subsection{Lor}
\label{sec:Lor}

Lor is a lesser deity of justice, law, discipline, good and the fight against
all evil. He is often depicted as an angelic humanoid creature that kneels
down with his two handed sword buried in the soil.

Lor himself is the current patriarch of \nameref{sec:Aurelis}, and is thus
among the younger lesser deities of Aror. His followers are always in direct
conflict with evil elements of the world. Lor's worship is well established
all across the world, and many welcome his knights and paladins as a means to
establish law and order, as well as a way to fight evils, such as daemons and
undead. After the death of \nameref{sec:Griannar} many children of the light
joined the church of Lor, with which the \nameref{sec:Church of Light} shared
many similar dogmas. This catapulted the church of Lor from being a small
knight order, to a global religion with churches and followers all across
Aror.

\subsubsection{Dogma}

The followers of Lor have one prevailing dogma, which is strictly controlled
by the church of Lor, called the \nameref{sec:Knight Order of Tavos}. The
church, and its leader the reigning patriarch or matriarch, reside in the city
kingdom of \nameref{sec:Hraglund}. The church preaches austerity, monogamy and
a strict life that rewards those that help the weak and wounded. Daily prayers
are required, as well as weekly attendance to masses. The priests of Lor often
guide a community of followers either alone, or with an adept they teach. The
followers of Lor are meant to seek out and destroy evil, even the evil that
resides within themselves. He instructs his followers to confess and repent,
for their signs and purge evil within them through fasting, prayer and devotion
to the common good.

Lor, and his followers, consider undead, devils (including tieflings), daemons,
demons, necromancers, and fey evil, and wicked. Lor openly encourages
anyone to seek out and destroy such evil, wherever it may lurk and hide. Lor
also abhors the manipulation of souls, and thus sees anyone that practise
\hyperref[sec:Soul Magic]{soul magic} as evil. This includes the shamans and
witches of the \nameref{sec:Old Ways}, who use soul magic through rituals and
incantations. Lor also abhors the evil practices of most druids, but tends to
stay clear of the vast rural areas (such as the Dirgewood) and thus rarely
comes in contact with either the old ways or druids. Lor, and his followers,
are suspicious about anyone who wields either psionic or arcane powers, and
often seeks policies to strictly regulate both forms of magic. Lor also opposes
widely practised evils, such as chattel slavery, or justice systems that rely
on an ``eye-for-an-eye'' mentally.

Most followers that dedicate themselves to Lor become priests, knights,
paladins or holy crusaders. Lor values dedication, hard work as well as
spiritual strength and resolve. The dogma is preserved and cultivated in the
\nameref{sec:Knight Order of Tavos}.

\subsubsection{Relations}

Lor is in direct conflict with pretty much all major evil or neutral gods and
religions, especially with \nameref{sec:Three Kings}, the \nameref{sec:Order},
as well as the major gods of the Old Ways. Lor sees these as heretic and
archaic forms of worship, practising or allowing practise and acts he considers
evil, such as slavery, humanoid sacrifice or soul magic rituals.

  Lor is considered \emph{lawful neutral}, and he is the patron of knights,
  paladins, fighters, and anyone who seeks to destroy evil. His favoured
  weapon is the two handed sword.
