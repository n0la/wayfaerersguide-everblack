\subsection{Lor}
\label{sec:Lor}

Lor is a lesser deity of justice, law, discipline, good and the fight against
all evil. He is often depicted as an angelic humanoid creature that kneels
down with his two handed sword buried in the soil.

\subsubsection{History}

He is among the older lesser deities of Aror, and was always in direct
conflict with evil elements of the world. His worship is well established
all across the world, and many welcome his knights and paladins as a means
to establish law and order, as well as a way to fight evils, such as
daemons and undead.

\subsubsection{Dogma}

The followers of Lor have one prevailing Dogma, which is strictly controlled
by the Church of Lor. The church, and its leader the reigning patriarch or
matriarch, reside in the city kingdom of \emph{Hraglund}. The church preaches
austerity, monogamy and a strict life that rewards those that help the weak
and wounded. Daily prayers are required, as well as weekly attendance to
masses. The priests of Lor often guide a community of followers either alone,
or with an adept they teach. The followers of Lor are meant to seek out and
destroy evil, even the evil that resides within themselves. He instructs his
followers to repent for their signs and purge evil within them through
flagellation, as well as help and aid others to atone for their signs.

To the followers of Lor undead, devils and fey are evil, and wicked. And Lor
openly encourages seeking out and destroying such evils. Lor also abhors
the manipulation of souls, and thus sees any that practise soul magic as
evil. This includes druids, those that follow the old ways or the three holy
mothers, or soul casters and witches.

Most followers that dedicate themselves to Lor become priests, knights,
paladins or monks. Lor values dedication, hard work as well as spiritual
strength and resolve. The dogma is preserved and cultivated in the
\nameref{sec:Knight Order of Tavos}.

\subsubsection{Relations}

Lor is in direct conflict with pretty much all major evil or neutral gods and
religions, especially with \nameref{sec:Three Kings}, the \nameref{sec:Order},
as well as the three other major gods \nameref{sec:Forun}, \nameref{sec:Nyddwr}
and \nameref{sec:Marwaid}. Lor sees these as heretic and archaic forms of
worship, practising or allowing practise of acts he considers evil, such as
slavery, humanoid worship or soul magic rituals.
