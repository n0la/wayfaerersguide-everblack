\subsection{Xir}
\label{sec:Xir}

\emph{Xir}, often called the \emph{beast below}, is fabled powerful being that
sleeps beneath the rivers of \nameref{sec:Muut}. It is often represented as a
large, finned and gilled reptilian with large and sharp teeth.

It is unknown of this creature lurks beneath the rivers, or if it is simply an
aspect of \nameref{sec:Isamir}. Nevertheless the creature is worshipped by the
\hyperref[sec:Savage Elves]{savage elves}, and their tribal shamans and clerics
receive divine aid and favour.

\subsubsection{Dogma}

The creature finds all monstrous and humanoid races filthy, repugnant and
unworthy. It displays a deep seated hatred and aversion to humanoid and
monstrous creatures, but states that anyone may be redeemed if they allow
themselves to be ``cleansed'', or aid others in being cleansed. Its followers
thus raid and capture other humanoid and monstrous races, and drown them in
the rivers in a holy ceremony in Xir's worship.

In truth Xir takes the souls and bodies into the river, and uses them to create
abomination to serve it. These abominations, half-humanoid half-fish creatures
are called \emph{Sahuagin}, and serve their master without question or will on
their own.

\begin{35e}{Xir}
  Xir is considered \emph{chaotic evil}, and its favoured weapon is the long
  spear. Its domains are water, evil, chaos and destruction.
