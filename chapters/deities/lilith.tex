\subsection{Lilith}
\label{sec:Lilith}

Lilith is one of the generals of the \hyperref[sec:Devils]{devils}, and is
thus also worshipped on Aror as a goddess. She is the goddess of sex, lust,
debauchery, and hedonism.

She has no official churches, or even dogma, but she is revered among the
wealthy that can frown in all sorts of excesses, those of sexual perversions
but also among sex workers and those sold to sexual slavery. Lilith's followers
indulge in food and sexual orgies, and follow their short-sighted pleasures
and indulgences to wherever they might take them.

Lilith's followers range from harmless but sexually curious, to the downtrodden
and exploited sexual workers and slave, to deranged and perverted. Since the
few spoil the apple basket, and the nature of the deity, most worship of Lilith
happens in secret.

Lilith has no dogma, no official rules or code to follow, but instead sends
succubi and incubi to her followers to hand out instructions, demands as well
as answer prayers and grant gifts.

\begin{35e}{Lilith}
  Lilith herself is \emph{lawful evil}, but she welcomes anyone to her religion
  that prefers indulgence over restraint. From the neutral good sex worker just
  trying to make a living, to the chaotic neutral gigolo that just lives for
  pleasures.

  Her domains are Passion, Charm, Evil and Trickery.
