\label{sec:Aria}

\aren{Traitor...}

\emph{Aria} is the lesser deity of secrets, intrigues, knowledge and hidden
things. She is often depicted as a woman clad hiding her face from onlookers.

\subsubsection{History}

Aria was once a powerful priestess of the \nameref{sec:Silent Queen}, before
she challenged the queen's reign during the conflict against
\nameref{sec:Griannar}.  During that challenge it is said that she was
responsible for killing the Silent Queen and usurping her domain, power and
rule over the extra-planar realm where the Silent Queen resided.

\subsubsection{Well of Truth}
\label{sec:Well of Truth}

She openly encourages hiding dangerous knowledge in hidden libraries and
archives. She, and her followers, believe that some knowledge is just too
powerful to be left in the hands of mere mortals. The followers of Aria
that go out and seek such knowledge to lock away, are called the \emph{Well of
  Truth}. This knowledge may include powerful artefacts and magical
techniques, that are deemed to dangerous. This puts her followers often in
direct conflict with most \hyperref[sec:Soul Magic]{soul magic} practitioners,
as well as those following the \hyperref[sec:Runemaster]{runemaster}. Followers
of the well do not research knowledge themselves, but instead see themselves
as guards against dangerous knowledge in the wrong hands. They are known for
stealing research from scientists and wizards, as well as killing researchers
so that their secrets may die with them.

\subsubsection{The Puppeteer}

Not only does she encourage the gathering of knowledge and information, she
also openly encourages her followers to use said knowledge for personal gain.
Many of her followers are thus often those that seek to control society from
the shadows, while amassing wealth and power in secrecy.

\subsubsection{Relations}

Aria is in direct conflict with the \nameref{sec:Runemaster}, as he gifts
powerful magic and teachings to mortals. She also openly opposes anyone who
seeks to investigate unethical practices such as necromancy. The
uncompromising methods of her followers, such as theft or outright
assassination, brings her and her followers often in direct conflict with the
\nameref{sec:Order} or the knights of \nameref{sec:Lor}.
