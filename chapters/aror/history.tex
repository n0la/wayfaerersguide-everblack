\section{History of the World}
\label{sec:History}

Proper recording of history started shortly before the foundation of the
first city kingdom of \nameref{sec:Fes al-Bashir}. The earliest scholars
were able to accurately reconstruct the earliest history with the help of
the Aurelis and the Dragons. These two races were advanced enough in the
early aeons of the humanoids of Aror, to accurately chronicle the history
of the core humanoid races.

The first race to settle Aror were the dragons, who found it uninhabited
of intelligent life, yet found that great and mighty beasts roamed the
planet. They opted to stay on the barren continent of \nameref{sec:Draigynus},
as to not disrupt the natural evolution of life on the planet. Their peaceful
life came to end, when the giants invaded Aror to wage war against the dragons,
and created intelligent monstrous creatures out of the beasts that roamed the
world. The giants engineered these monstrous races to be intelligent, and
aggressive in an attempt to create the perfect soldiers for their campaign
against the dragons.

According to the dragons, the \nameref{sec:Tynrikke} where elevated to
intelligence by the giants yet revolted against them. The TÃ½n instead joined
the dragons in their battle for survival, and would be instrumental in
driving the giants from Aror.

While the war on the surface raged between the dragons and the giants,
the \nameref{sec:Ilians} became ever more intelligent and organised, resulting
in the creation of the great Ilian civilisation. Unlike the other intelligent
races at the time, who either came from other planes or were engineered, the
Ilians were the first intelligent life that was native to Aror.

\subsection{Second Ice Age}
\label{sec:Second Ice Age}

Roughly sixty thousand years ago an ice age covered most of the world
of \emph{Aror} in vast sheets of ice and snow. Continents that were separated
by sea, where now suddenly accessible through thick sheets of ice. This
allowed the \textbf{four core humanoid races}, the
\hyperref[sec:Humans]{humans}, \hyperref[sec:Elves]{elves},
\hyperref[sec:Dwarves]{dwarves} and \hyperref[sec:Halflings]{halflings}
to migrate away from \nameref{sec:Arania} and settle the entire known
world. Although the humanoid races were successful in adapting to the new
lands and challenges, they had to face fierce opposition.

\subsection{Aeon of Strife}
\label{sec:Aeon of Strife}

When the humanoid races arrived in the other continents around a thousands of
years before the aeon of \emph{GT}, they found that they were already
inhabited by sentient races. \textbf{Monstrous races} such as ogres,
minotaurs, orcs, trolls, hobgoblins, gnolls, bugbears already called these
continents their home, alongside non-sentient monstrous species such as
hydras, manticores and wyverns. Through ancient stories of the dwarves, early
writings, ancient stone tablets, tales from the \hyperref[sec:Dragons]{dragons},
and even cave paintings, it was revealed that the humanoid ancestors were in a
constant state of conflict with these monstrous races. Wars, skirmishes, and
often the destruction of entire early villages and even cities was a common
occurrence in early history. This early time of constant fighting, turmoil and
wars against the sentient beast races is now referred to as the \emph{aeon of
  strife}.

The aeon saw the birth of many new races, such as
\hyperref[sec:Vampires]{vampires}, \hyperref[sec:Fey]{fey} and
\hyperref[sec:Lycanthropes]{lycanthropes}. It also saw a vast destruction of
nature, as both sides of the war cut down forests, dried swamps, and forever
corrupted landscapes and areas with dark and foul magic. The aeon of strife
lasted well into the aeon of \emph{GT}.

Even though the aeon of strife is now hundreds of years in the past, it is
still vividly remembered in both humanoid and monstrous cultures through
stories, song, and tradition.

\subsection{Schism}
\label{sec:Schism}

The ultimately successful survival strategy to deal with such a hostility
during the strife ingrained itself as the cultural core of the humanoid
races. Many dwarves went underground and organised themselves in strict
hierarchical clans and cities, that allowed them to optimise their economies to
the harsh realities and lack of resources of the depths. Some humans and elves
followed the dwarves underground but ultimately failed to replicate their
success. With a few notable exceptions, such as \nameref{sec:Stenheim}.
Although the \nameref{sec:Deepkin}, the underground dwelling cousins of the
humans, built large civilisations underground they were ultimately defeated by
the \nameref{sec:Ilians} of the depths and driven to the surface. The dark elves
instead relied on small clans, families and by being constantly on the move to
ensure the survival of their species.

Meanwhile on the surface elves and halflings sought to settle as far away from
the monstrous races as possible, leading them to the continent of \emph{South
Goltir} and \emph{Farlar}. Other elves settled in the frozen north and south,
becoming known as the \nameref{sec:Snow Elves}.

Humans on the other hand used their ingenuity and skill to build great
civilisations and cities that could potentially withstand the skirmishes and
sieges of the sentient monstrous races. They were not alone, as many elves
(now known as \nameref{sec:Wood Elves}), and some halflings and dwarves stayed
with them. Through many iterations over the course of thousands of years,
which resulted in countless destroyed and ransacked cities and fallen
civilisations, these humanoids have now achieved the unthinkable: dethrone the
monstrous races as the predominant species across all of Aror.

\subsection{Great Exodus}
\label{sec:Great Exodus}

Now many elves and halflings have joined the human effort of building large
centres of civilisation, enriching the predominantly human city kingdoms that
dot the world of \emph{Aror}. Their struggle against the sentient monstrous
races is far from over, especially in the central regions of the continents,
or from the still predominantly monstrous continent of \emph{IÃ¢fandir}. The
majority of dwarves have remained underground, continuing their strict ways of
life as it has served them for aeons. A success that was not shared by the
dark elves and deepkin, who have mostly abandoned the deep and returned to the
surface

\subsection{War in Heaven}
\label{sec:War in Heaven}

The ``War in Heaven'' (also known as the ``great war in heaven'') started in
GT:-7633 (almost 12,000 years ago), when the \nameref{sec:Scourge} successfully
gained a foothold on the \nameref{sec:Aurelis} home world of Celestis. This war
raged for over six hundred years, killing countless of Aurelis, destroying their
culture, society and leaving half of their planet uninhabitable. During the war,
the Aurelis attempted to free some of the demons from the psionic slavery of the
\nameref{sec:Abyss}. These newly freed demons refused to aid the Aurelis, and
instead left to find themselves a new homeworld. These freed demons became known
as the ``pacru\'i'' or \nameref{sec:Devils}. During the war, the Aurelis' king
\nameref{sec:Lor} made himself known to the people of Aror, in an effort to
recruit external help for his war.

\subsection{First City Kingdoms}

The tide of the aeon long war against the monstrous humanoids turned in favour
for the humanoid races when the first large city kingdoms were founded. These
huge and vast cities provided defence, security and above else a place where
society, culture, and means of production could grow and flourish. The first
city kingdom to be founded was \nameref{sec:Fes al-Bashir}, and its success
in the battles during the aeon of strife, was soon copied across the world.
The early years of what is now the the aeon of \emph{GT}, saw the formation
of many powerful nations, such as \nameref{sec:Hraglund}, \nameref{sec:Esmayar}
and \nameref{sec:Helmarnock}, which helped cement the humanoid victory and
conquest with brick and stone.
