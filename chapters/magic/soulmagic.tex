\section{Soul Magic}
\label{sec:Soul Magic}

Soul magic is one of three main pillars of magic on Aror, alongside divine
magic (and its closely related cousin arcane magic) and psionic
powers. It taps into the very soul of the caster, and thus, much like psionic
energy, is inherent to caster and does not come from external sources like
divine or arcane energy.

All living creatures on Aror have a soul, that is fundamentally intertwined
with the body. Normally no creature is aware of its own soul, and must first
experience a traumatic event called a \emph{soul awakening}. During the
awakening the inherent bond between the body and the soul are broken, and the
soul is free to be experienced on its own.

\subsection{Soul Awakening}
\label{sec:Soul Awakening}

A \emph{soil awakening} is by nature a traumatic event for both body and soul.
During the awakening the inherent connections that interweave both the body and
the soil are disrupted, allowing each to live without the other. Bodies that
live without their soils are often corporeal undead, such as zombies,
skeletons and \hyperref[sec:Umgeher]{umgeher}. Souls without a body are also
often undead, such as wraiths, ghosts and spirits.

Those that experience soul awakening have their soul broken, and must first
heal before they can tap their souls for power. There are a few ways to heal
a broken soul, such as rest, intense mental and bodily training, or specific
soul spells.

Awakenings come from traumatic experiences that either affect the body or the
soul. Near death experiences, loss of someone important, necromancy, or being
intentionally soul broken by another spell caster are some of the more common
ways to awake.

\begin{35e}{Soul Awakened}
Soul Awakened is an acquired template that can be added to any living
intelligent creature that has a soul (referred to hereafter as base
creature). This template cannot be taken, only acquired.
\srditem{Requirements}{The base creature must have had a significant incident
  with souls, soul magic or a traumatic event in the past to be allegible for
  this template.
}
\srditem{Size and Type}{The base creature’s type and size remains unchanged,
  and retains all of the base creature’s statistics and special abilities
  except as noted here.
}
\srditem{Skills}{An awakened creature immediately adds Knowledge (Soul Magic)
  and Soulcraft to its list of available class skills. See this article on
  soul magic for details.
}
\srditem{Awaken (Ex)}{A soul awakened creature can attempt, once per day, to
  awaken a non-awakend being with a soul. The target must be be willing, and
  if it is not, the attempt simply fails using up the attempt for the day. The
  awakened creature must touch his target, upon which the target must succeed
  a will save (DC: 15 + HD of target) and a fortitude save (DC: 15 + HD of
  target). If the will save fails then the target’s soul becomes broken. If
  the fortitude save fails then the body rejects the soul, and both take 2d6
  points of damage (for 4d6 points in total).
