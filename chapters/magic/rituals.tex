\section{Rituals}
\label{sec:Rituals}

Rituals, or incantations, are powerful \emph{soul magic} or \emph{divine}
rituals can be cast by anyone, even those that are not arcane or divine
casters. These rituals often require specific words to be chanted, ritual
places specifically crafted and arranged for the incantation, often take
several hours of preparation and then to perform, and often require more than
person to be successfully performed.

The most prominent source of rituals are the lore and history of the
\nameref{sec:Old Ways}, as well as the lore of druidic circles. While the old
ways use rituals to heal, the druids use them for nefarious purposes, such as
cursing enemies with \hyperref[sec:True Lycanthropes]{true lycanthropy}.
